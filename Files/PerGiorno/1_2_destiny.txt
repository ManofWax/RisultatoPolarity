1451693650	why do you even play ironman if you cant handle team deaths?

1451693689	@DeandreT, Then again, who wouldn't be if they were forced to play LoL for a living.
1451693704	He definitely isn't forced to play LoL
1451693723	He would keep the views if he played another game?
1451693726	hope his channel wasn't closed for good. might make him even more depressed if he loses this

1451693745	That moment when Gosu just says he wants to kill himself at that age just like everyone else around that age does at one point of their lives and it ends up blowing way out of proportion and he's regretting it very embarrassingly since it got so much attention Kappa

1451693766	err om
1451693768	ok
1451693775	And even if most of his viewerbase didn't stay he could rebuild most of it because he's already pretty big in the scene.
1451693775	he knows he cant get perfect right?

1451693794	destiny that hair length is a good look on you btw
1451693813	@DeandreT, Yeah, but maybe he has bills to pay that can only be paid at 5000 viewers.

1451693884	He has two chats
1451693893	@Destiny height gives +20 aim. does worth going for the rooftops. Especially with rookies
1451693894	He is

1451694025	@DeandreT, I thought you were saying that a therapist would cost too much for someone with that much viewers. You meant the opposite?
1451694030	Yeah
1451694034	this looks like a shitty game
1451694045	i would get bored in 2 seconds

1451694057	he's one tile over, behind the van
1451694057	cool
1451694064	why are we talking about money? theres other reasons to be depressed besides money
1451694065	Maybe he gets flanking protection from the aliem mind powers
1451694066	its actually really fn
1451694091	@Dakuten, yes, but money can be a fuck ton of things that can help you deal with. You don't have such luxuries when you're.
1451694096	buy*
1451694096	Dakuten because that's sort of what destiny implied in the first place.
1451694101	fun as in not being able to blow a van with a granate?
1451694102	this game is good, it's just destiny failing to get to the fun parts

1451694139	@DeandreT, I know you can still have a chemical imbalance, but money opens so many doors that you can deal a lot better with depression than when you're poor.
1451694150	is he cucked yet?
1451694151	btw this game is fun just not on impossible PEPE
1451694155	This game is adequate at what it tries to do, but I don't like at all what they did to the classic X-Com formula
1451694175	i rate this game 2 out of 10
1451694177	What are the differences @kreegath ?
1451694178	lw impossible is really unfair
1451694179	That`s what i call chemistry zo.gd/9RKmK Kappa
1451694188	There are huge differences Swiftbro
1451694194	for example?

1451694305	Yeah therapy is expensive as fuck and it's really hard to actually want to invest that money in trying to fix your situation when you're depressed. It's pretty much impossible to do when you can barely pay rent.

1451695122	it's all ogre
1451695124	rip
1451695127	another one bites the dust\\
1451695184	im 18 quests in and 1 deceaced
1451695186	another restart
1451695189	why keep restart?
1451695196	YEE
1451695197	on ironman impossible? DeathInNote
1451695198	resolution for 2017
1451695202	finish this game
1451695203	Its xcom and he has autisn
1451695203	˙͜ >˙
1451695213	what has been the biggest yee combo today?
1451695221	Don't take any chances? RESTART
1451695236	naahh just normal im just learning the game. i know hes doing it the hard way :D
1451695238	is this the same map as the 99% xcom meme from 3 years ago
1451695260	he hasn't accepted the true reality yet. But he's getting there. Damage is fine now, just no deaths. Soon we get to the "only two guys dead so it's fine" :D
1451695263	Won't complain if he used Second wave options to make it a tad easier
1451695324	if only he had the option on where you can see the aliens' chance to hit
1451695328	second wave just allows you to bring in more dudes right?
1451695358	second wave has tons of options, that's one of them
1451695361	Aliens? restart
1451695367	@Destiny make your most revealing move first. Keep the squad together. Overwatch everyone as the last action of your turn, not the last action of the soldier so everyone at least gold move
1451695370	stream is back FeelsGoodMan
1451695377	SwiftRage flanked
1451695378	Theres second wave "cinematic" that makes soldiers aim better
1451695379	Can you play piano Destiny?
1451695388	Happy new year
1451695393	thanks you too
1451695402	you too m90
1451695411	happy new year to you too lad
1451695422	There's tons of second wave options (let you choose classes, injured soldiers/aliens get less stats, better air accuracy, better ground accuracy and a lot that make the game even harder)

1451708220	he is russia, just the wrong russia KappaRoss
1451708291	this game is hardest right at the start
1451708319	difficulty doesnt keep up once you get armors, or at least its not as bullshit random ded
1451708335	like first 2 terror missions make or break original game run
1451708339	Damn this is kinda really boring
1451708371	not enough memes ResidentSleeper
1451708380	@Destiny you'll have problems with the drones with an all carbine squad, the shotgun helps a lot tho
1451708409	does Xcom have like a endless / sandbox / not story mode?
1451708428	5 by 5 is radio talk, it means good signal essentially
1451708438	Drones have DR - damage resistance. You won't do enough damage when you hit
1451708443	Just get XJ9 out of there safely. He's got a pony at home waiting.
1451708532	get those toss bastards
1451708539	Yes it's a LW thing - although these are baby drones, only 1 DR
1451708576	you can try the assault - run and gun
1451708593	rip
1451708611	that was weird
1451708614	RNJESUS
1451708626	Shotgun is more affect by DR than any other weapon type

1451711139	starcraft streams always use korean years

1451712097	I don't need to be moderated! I am well behaved
1451712108	Sir_TallBlonde, twitch chat had stability problems in the past and also he wanted to make a community site not affected by his move to other streaming services (in the past he had switched to own3d and stuff and never know if twitch will be here forever)
1451712129	@Popohad, in due time you will slip my young padawan
1451712133	Sir_TallBlonde, he also gets a larger cut of subscriptions there compared to what twitch gives with their program
1451712134	there are other streaming sites? Keepo
1451712142	not any good ones right now FrankerZ
1451712170	The PM community uses hitbox but its not great
1451712184	always knew RTBA was a shitter
1451712185	everyone needs to be moderated. You need to know that there are people out there with more power than you and are generally better than you as well
1451712187	WutFace
1451712190	@Popohad, whats PM
1451712212	what was destiny expecting from rtba lol
1451712218	Project M, a brawl mod that is pretty much not being worked on any more due to threat of nintendo action
1451712221	fire that 9 miss guy
1451712242	that seems weird that nintendo would give a shit about that
1451712246	but they still let pokemonshowdown exist
1451712251	i guess pokemon is gamefreak tho
1451712256	is RTBA british and black?
1451712261	spooky position

1451712275	a subsidiray of Nintendo co
1451712280	But in any case the devs stopped working on PM, and it doesnt get in big tournaments any more
1451712299	Well very much. Also Twitch is trying to kill it too apparently so they had to go to hitbox
1451712310	It is a big conspiracy

1451712323	what game are we talking abt?
1451712327	PM
1451712331	hell yeah dad playing one of my favorite games!
1451712341	oh i guess game freak, nintendo, and some other company all own shares in the pokemon company and that company does copyright stuff
1451712342	so complex
1451712346	i mean, no streaming site is going to want to host a game mod that is in active litigation, or is being threatened with it
1451712347	is that .4^10?
1451712351	It's amazing how the Aliens have started to flank Destiny and he's still somehow alive
1451712356	does steady shot last only one turn?
1451712358	no conspiracy, just business
1451712360	Hi Destiny, I like your jacket today.
1451712401	pokemon showdown is crazy good, 11k~ concurrent users, has assets right from pokemon games
1451712406	somehow not shut down FeelsGoodMan
1451712418	Is that the online battle thing?
1451712422	yea
1451712436	I want some of these super bullets that can go through earthen terrain
1451712467	oh god
1451712468	rng is cruel tho
1451712469	threw?
1451712470	hes in deep
1451712471	thats just regular bullets
1451712487	Dont you have to reload
1451712490	I just joined, and see paint, this is good
1451712491	The focus fire is good for rockets
1451712521	It' hard to understand Destiny with his pre-school handwriting I'll do my besst
1451712524	the boost would have to be better than double your chances to hit
1451712534	murdaDeez murdaDeez murdaDeez murdaDeez
1451712535	LOOL
1451712540	wtf where are the headphones
1451712546	Its better... why? Well, because. Kappa
1451712556	it is about a .01% chance to miss 10 40%s in a row I think right? .4^10
1451712574	DJ_Cred, he prefers the audio fidelity of the speakers built into his monitor
1451712576	I guess if you dont have a shot you can steady instead of overwatch
1451712578	that math seems solid, but the situtation on the ground might be different... felxibility is better
1451712584	@Destiny Does streaming sufficiently support you monetarily?
1451712600	they could of saved alot of money designing this lvl if all you needed to do was stay in one spot
1451712601	obviously
1451712608	How far into the game is he?
1451712619	theres overwatch aim penalty still right?
1451712626	not far at all Swooped
1451712640	turbo cucked
1451712645	it's .001 chance to miss 10x in a row at 40%
1451712654	wow
1451712666	and?
1451712676	will destiny actually be able to complete a run of this game?
1451712678	asap
1451712679	no
1451712680	thats not really how probability works, but whatever
1451712682	Kappa
1451712695	if you miss 9x in a row the next hit is basically 100%
1451712700	Kappa
1451712700	there is like zero probability of him beating this game
1451712701	@Destiny your math is right, but here, you only need to hit one shot, also, usually you have multiple turns to prepare, and a single turn of decisive engagement, rest is mop-up. Assuming of course that you don't go for the outsider first pulling in all the enemies on the map at once.
1451712703	what is longwar?
1451712715	Destiny's full run of a game is 85%
1451712725	Long War is an XCOM mod that makes everything tedious and boring but calls that "challenge"
1451712740	still cant believe he didnt finish the witcher 3
1451712742	people will forget all about it in a month when XCOM2 comes out

1451712803	weow those injuries
1451712830	the developers of xcom said that long war is better then their original game and they'll be including more tools for xcom 2 so i imagine we'll see longwar 2
1451712840	can't you cut off your characters head in this game and put them in a gundam?
1451712852	what
1451712863	Max injury in the later months is 55 days xD
1451712874	yeah
1451712879	thats like half dead
1451712889	you cant see him
1451712906	is this the Long War mod?
1451712907	Maiayenuhs yeah in enemy Within you can, doesn't seem like he's playing with that though
1451712916	destiny which 4chan board will spawn the big meme of this year?
1451712928	Long War has some great ideas and mechanics but its playability is wrapped in so much tedium... its certainly not for everyone
1451712947	noobsquad
1451712953	What second wave options does he have?
1451712967	Is that a *** she looks like she's packing that long dick?
1451712979	What does long war change?

1451713027	is this a disney song?
1451713041	look at that beard I bet that guy is a Dank Memer
1451713071	OuO
1451713109	Are those new pillows on Destiny's couch? I think it's a safe bet he didn't buy them
1451713131	thats the good thing about having a girl they buy comfy shit
1451713150	I bet he doesn't even appreciate it
1451713153	yeah but they wont let you sit on the dang pillows...
1451713153	Long war change a lot (More equipement diversity [especially early on], more diversified pods, more/bigger pods per map, 8 classes instead of 4, 8 mec classes, start with 6 man squad, leader mobs, more complex/difficult air combat, economy more build around request/gray market than satellite coverage, reworks of explosives, ...)
1451713161	haha
1451713191	Make way for the queen's guard! SwiftRage
1451713224	basically if you wanted to run XCOM as an actual government beaurocracy, Long War is for you
1451713233	you ain't no alien bruhv!!
1451713242	I hope destiny plays darkest dungeons when the full game comes out i loved watching him play it the last time
1451713247	Yeah I just like watching XCOM. Not the biggest fan of long war, not sure all the things they added are necessary. Wider variations in damage on top of variations to hit irks me a little. Air Combat also got to be more of a crapshoot. I get that the air game was a bit shallow to start with but not sure I like how long war handled it
1451713276	still a fun mod, great work all around so Kappa // to the team
1451713277	remember fish ai?
1451713278	a lot of thigns are just change for change sake, tbh
1451713282	yes
1451713301	tedium = length = challenge
1451713312	not true
1451713318	FF tactics mod is a good ex
1451713322	its not that much more tactically deep, though i do like the new classes
1451713328	not more tedious, just more strategy
1451713329	FF tactics CoolCat
1451713338	That's the real memes
1451713339	The game looks fun but not worth $80
1451713358	@Fear_Silence, youre right, it's worth 100 Kappa
1451713366	this game is not $80
1451713382	Wait is this not xcom 2?
1451713394	is it february?
1451713397	XCom 2 isn't out until February

1451713416	If they are being serious they don't fuck around with threats
1451713425	You can actually custom a lot of things in long war, for exemple I totally nerfed the air game (less repair time/ purchase cost for interceptor), slightly upped minimum stats for rookies, greatly reduced injury times (from 55 to 15), removed increased fatigue from officer/psi, ...
1451713427	oh okay
1451713433	what did a guy say?
1451713433	how do people come to a stream and not even know what game is being played? its listed at the top! and in the title!
1451713442	so I would like to talk about how my family members screwed up bringing pizza to my house today. Since I made dinner for New Year's Eve they wanted to help and bring something to eat for New Year's Day. I suggested pizza and told them where to go. They called me at 3:30 to tell me they were picking up the pizza. Fast forward to 5:00 and they show up and then we eat cold pizza. Btw the pizza place is 5 minutes from my house.
1451713445	You can even change the skill tree if you want I think.
1451713446	Yeah Coldparadox for sure
1451713462	well I ve been watching destiny for years but im not a fan of xcom
1451713478	@MaiAyeNuhs, cant think of anything i care about less

1451713520	cold pizza is alright
1451713523	@mai I think no one gives a flying fox

1451713565	@mai maybe blog about it?
1451713580	Mai, they probably went somewhere else
1451713594	You think cold pizza is allright. Does that mean you think there's no difference in quality from fresh hot pizza and cold pizza

1451761118	The trump line in this game is so effective at getting rid of illegal aleins :^)
1451761126	mar45690, DansGame Protoss
1451761142	it should
1451761151	you cant determine it, its based on environmental damage
1451761157	yes it should
1451761168	but it will almost certainly destroy the desk
1451761177	why do none of these building have roofs Kappa
1451761180	centre of the blast is more effective, but until I get sapper I never trust it
1451761184	lol
1451761187	knowing when it does separates the good players from the great ones destiny
1451761192	FailFish
1451761205	very fucked
1451761228	Fucking sniper probe.
1451761241	actually I think you need a sapper with explosive damage perk to destroy objects in LW or rocketeer
1451761269	wrong Fuyocouch
1451761275	It just makes it way more likely
1451761281	well sooooorryyy
1451761291	apology accepted
1451761292	I'm feeling pretty surpressed FeelsBadMan
1451761300	lol

1451761313	well why didnt grenade destroy objects then?
1451761315	FailFish
1451761330	damnit destiny why do you make me want to play this game again
1451761345	its based on environmental damage Fuyocouch
1451761373	LW has less environmental damage, need sapper perk to deal decent demolition
1451761373	its probably expired
1451761374	desk was on the edge of the radius of the explosive so received a fraction of the damage from the grenade
1451761382	ah right
1451761386	thats true about getting meld by beating map before it expires
1451761390	yes, tzhis
1451761393	it should work like that, yes.

1451762067	That mission was so poorly played, there's no chance he beats I/I without significantly improving the way he plays this game lol
1451762067	this game is just way too difficult first play through on impossible.
1451762081	this isnt his first play through though is it
1451762082	It's not his first play through
1451762092	BibleThump

1451762165	Better Call Saul Starts again on Feb 15th HYPE PogChamp
1451762169	naw it gets boring. he tilts and its like a silent movie

1451762950	but its german engineers
1451762967	isnt that even better?
1451762979	@Destiny veal scallopini
1451762986	It's not worth it... you would get the return on investment over a loooong time... there are better things to do with the $100.. i.e. to stay alive
1451763005	lol what the fuck do you even do with money that early
1451763011	he cant build anything yet
1451763017	put a satellite over your moms house so we can watch her at night
1451763019	@Destiny if you send a satellite over a country without request you just get the montly income, with a request it's an extra bonus
1451763020	he should satellite
1451763029	the month is long as hell, dude.

1451763207	LUL
1451763213	Ya its the reason why a day later and we are on the same mission
1451763216	It's not like he's never done ironman impossible before

1451763287	actually, you can check how many engineers you would get for an actual workshop instead of a request and then compare the price of the satellite and the workshop to see if it's worth it.

1451765711	is a macbook pro retina 15 better than a windows laptop?
1451765718	you will use it on the majority of maps
1451765720	Lone Wolf, for when you really want your Sniper to get into auto-asphyxiation.
1451765728	@C0lex I have one, it's not better but it's also not worse
1451765733	so what skill gives him the best chances to get 360 noscopes?
1451765733	lone wolf is the best choice here
1451765734	cmon 7 tiles is not that far
1451765736	yeah c0lex get a macbook pro and some beats headphones breh
1451765762	He's not always way in the back though, low profile would have been good second half of last mission
1451765771	just FYI, Thin man make's layton accuracy look like shit, they will hit you from that far back :)

1451766332	to autistic to read
1451766334	so i always play brazil :D
1451766337	with sniper rifle you cant shoot if you move
1451766347	you can after the perk
1451766351	Not really the worst item slot. Depends on the mission and what you expect to fight, objectives, etc.
1451766363	8% crit increase
1451766366	Is he using any third party mods or just official DLC?
1451766372	Long War

1451766373	i don't know, i would never take it over a scope or armor personally
1451766375	for me any item slot is a grenade slot, smoke, AP, HE, Flashbang
1451766376	yeah but you are not going to get perk to move with sniper rifle in a long time
1451766393	@destiny you can move with marksman rifle before you shoot
1451766395	Scope and armor are mostly for if you like rolling the dice.

1451766416	Vest more mobile, armor more hp.
1451766423	@Mom0momo one has more armor the other more mobility
1451766430	tac has 1 more movement, armor has 1 more hp
1451766436	why doesnt destiny make me a mod?
1451766448	D. Trump is hella fat in your game x)

1451766462	NO
1451766463	it makes your shit harder to hit
1451766464	No, because you don't need a scope/armor if you tilt the situation in favor of you landing, or never being hit. Aliens can't shoot you in obscured cover, and a point-blank shotgun isn't going to miss.

1451775881	dude the cat was like grasping for air halfway through the video
1451775888	she was definitely choking it
1451775889	lmao
1451775892	the cat died, RIP in pieces
1451775897	it didnt die lol
1451775898	she said she did it so the cats claw wouldnt get ripped out
1451775899	Why send 1 at a time!?
1451775899	she was trying to remove the claw
1451775899	i think that cat was just sick of her shit

1451775938	most cats don't like to be held like that and would have responded the same way regardless of "choking"
1451775939	WOW
1451775940	Why the fuck can you only send one interceptor at a time?
1451775942	This is what you guys have done.

1451775945	yeah i saw it also destiny and his gf was like choking that poor cat
1451775947	i think shes full of shit about the claw, maybe she was choking it without realizing it but if you focus on the cat you can tell it is in a visible struggle
1451775950	Easier difficulty, pls.
1451775950	its just a fucking cat why do people even care about this after like 3 days
1451775953	HOW MANY SORTIES DOES IT TAKE TO SHOOT DOWN AN UFO?

1451775971	what up, did I miss the train wreck yet Kappa
1451775983	time to go to d.gg
1451775984	i mean you dont see it with your eye, but you feel it
1451775985	Cherry, if a cat is in a visible struggle it is much more apparant
1451775986	if you look closely at the video, the claw is in her arm at one point, but then the cat removes his paw and she does the thing that people observe as choking
1451775990	Your Mom was an inside job Kappa
1451775997	Grrrrrr
1451776003	hurting cats and dogs does, because most people have very fond memories and interactions with these domesticated animals
1451776007	she was holding the cat down and trying to remove the claw why wont u take her word for it but believe her about showing whos boss
1451776008	also cats can get pretty pissed without being choked
1451776024	@EnvyUK, not when it's being suffocated
1451776041	holy shit, people are going crazy over poor density accidentally causing minor discomfort to a cat.
1451776045	This chat reminds me of Reddit, oversensitive SJWs everywhere whose lives are so fucking meaningless that a cat being strangled is worth talking about for 3 days
1451776049	@Cherrysun, are you kidding, it would be much more apparent if it was actually being choked
1451776054	Time for game of throws
1451776057	why don't you guys just shut up about some retarded titty streamer holy shit
1451776059	WE DID IT REDDIT
1451776068	do people start flipping out when they are being choked?
1451776077	Haha yes
1451776077	cherry, i once saw a video of a guy smashing a dog with a stone brick, the dog screaming and wheezing. this video was quite mild, you can't be sure of what she did
1451776078	no
1451776079	nah, it slows your system down hardcore when you cant get air
1451776081	I think the whole cat strangling situation wouldnt have been such a big deal if she didnt make stupid tweets afterwards
1451776082	she grabbed the cat slightly wrong and it scratched her...thats all...BUT since this is the internent everyone needs to get out their pitch forks and get HER BANNED
1451776082	a cat would fuck your shit up before it starts getting strangled get real
1451776083	same with cats
1451776084	They like being choked
1451776088	if only you had infantry guys
1451776105	cattybatty
1451776106	Anything being choked against it's will flips out in a big way

1451776114	So she is cat hitler, we get it ResidentSleeper
1451776118	and it did, it tried to bite her and scratch ehr
1451776120	You can't even choke a cat. They literally have nine lives.
1451776122	she basically just dug her own grave while digging herself out of the situation
1451776122	Wait I saw all this referencing to choking a cat... is that a new euphemism for jerking it?
1451776129	^@cruch
1451776130	view, yes
1451776131	You enter a fight or flight mode and your whole body will spasm to find air
