1451952316	DuckerZ
1451952317	Love how this is a video defaming an SC2 player on reddit is allowed here.On top of that there is no context that cloudm players (including, but not just this "jasonm") have been sniping my stream in an attempt to gain exposure for years now from HOTS -> LOTV.
1451952329	People here will circlejerk/hate all they want because that's all they can do, and people wonder why there's no good SC2 content when instead of throwing shit at the players in the community that stream the game everyday you could pay attention to the good content that promotes the gameplay of the game, not bullshit streamer drama and more reddit hate.
1451952336	@destiny Any better music yet?
1451952343	@Tingping1 WHOA BRO ZOZZLE
1451952347	I also don't deny that i've called this guy a hacker since HOTS because him and the other wastes of life in cloudm/imbaqq/etc consistently have stream sniped + stream cheated against me for the past 2 years.

1452023768	Jax_jaguars32, it didn't cut through because of the frequency and shit. You could see that the baton was getting overloaded during the fight for a second, though. If Finn were any good with a lightsaber he could have easily won. He was just blindly swinging it.

1452023882	@nuja_93 I'm not even trying
1452023898	@mom0momo they phased out most the clones before episode 4 even happened
1452023900	i cant believe luke is han's son
1452023903	MoM0MoMo, the movie mentions that Hux's soldiers are trained from birth, not clones.

1452023917	not with that attitude

1452023957	thats JEdi training
1452023959	@Stealthsin That and the fact that she is literally a flawless character, oh never flew the millennium falcon before, doesnt matter super pro at that lol, never used the force before doesnt matter super pro at that lol
1452023961	>losing to protoss
1452023962	Spoilers............................the lightsaber part was all luck
1452023967	She has training, she has a mental block in her mind to forget she was trained in the past.
1452023970	rey actress Kreygasm
1452023974	and Kylo hasn't had a REAL competitor in ages
1452023974	Stealthsin, some theories exist that also say that Rey was already trained before, but lost her memory. Or that the lightsaber "gifted" her some memories of its previous owners that helped her out.
1452023975	Anyone? Why did GM ladder reset?
1452023976	SPOILERS--------------- she knew how to fight with her staff already. the bull shit was that she knew how to mind trick already
1452023978	remember when destiny had a twitter account EleGiggle
1452023982	Spoilers!!!!!!!....................English actors are hot Kreygasm
1452023984	@noxialedm apart from the fact Kylo just took a direct hit to the chest from the bowcaster that had been shown one shooting multiple people previously in the film
1452023991	SPOILERS --------------------------------------------------- Finn vs. Kylo is Black on Black Crime.
1452023998	thanks obama
1452024000	Jortalus i hope thats the case..
1452024003	Nuja_93, well, it was more like a direct hit to his gut/hip
1452024004	@NoxialEDM, SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------- ren was shot by chewie, that thing hurts. Also, Rey is like a rebellion fanatic or something, she knew a bunch of stuff about luke, han, etc, so she probably heard about things people can do with the force
1452024005	Luke's lightsaber is a horcrux, i mean a holocron

1452024032	@jortalus either way it would have killed a normal man
1452024036	Stealthsin, it helped her out.
1452024071	luke skywalker in new star wars --------->https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Fh6eLXGmog/maxresdefault.jpg
1452024072	Also Leia look ugly as shit, they should have killed her off.
1452024074	fucking neural parasite...
1452024075	Nuja_93, oh no doubt. I think half the reason we saw Han blowing so many people away with the Bowcaster was to prove that it was more powerful than an average blaster. Then Ren takes a direct hit, gets right back up, and still manages to do hella stuff without "complete training"
1452024082	and the knowledge that kylo didnt want to kill her at the end probably helped
1452024087	Nuja_93, that said I think Kylo Ren is the best new character for sure.
1452024104	@Destiny, My gf just dumped me... I need your wisdom and advice. Happy 2016 everyone.

1452024164	omg so dumb, chain fungals BUT still gives the zealots what they want to attack lings
1452024165	Who won
1452024173	Jortalus cant agree about Kylo Ren. He is angry whiny bitch and got beat up by a girl
1452024173	Wtf why is he not gm now?
1452024173	Flex
1452024175	@Standardpwnage, Don't bring him back? He's the second main villian that is going to revolve around the entire new trilogy lol
1452024176	why's he masters? different server?
1452024177	is destiny playing on EU?
1452024178	yeah they buffed zealot charge
1452024186	@uvsvdu, Every single gm was demoted
1452024188	PogChamp @Stealthsin
1452024200	@Curtsy really?
1452024200	oh damn, whys that curtsy?
1452024203	a whopping 4 people in GM
1452024204	^^^
1452024204	Yes really
1452024206	20 lurkers PogChamp
1452024206	Anyone know where is Nathanias today? I miss him :(
1452024206	han solo isnt dead hes coming back just like boba fett and darth maul
1452024210	@stealthsin yeah he's a flawed character, not a badass like Vader, that's kinda his character
1452024215	^
1452024219	They locked the ladder and then everyone was kicked when it was unlocked
1452024222	But if you wall with roacher to protect lurkers should be fine. And have hydra in the back for dps
1452024225	Stealthsin, The dark side is defined by anger and hatred, though. What's wrong with showing some of the symptoms of that in a relatively untrained example?
1452024241	Guys you don't have to sit through countless of hours of boring ass SC2 games anymore. Someone uploads all the interesting debates and talks from Destiny on this Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjMtzuEYwPE7Y88upYLyUcw
1452024243	GM was accidentally reset as when everyone got their bonus' pools from the league lock bug that happened for the past week. it treated everyone as if they had been inactive and removed from GM.
1452024245	@Nuja_93 he is way more than flawed. When he took the costume off there was nothing left.
1452024250	Kylo Ren is the Anakin Conflict we never saw cause EP 1 2 3 skipped him Jortalus Stealthsin
1452024254	I hate how every critic that has praised starwars would have destroyed any other movie if it had as weak of a plot and character development, but gives starwars a pass because its starwars. seriously it was a pretty shit movie.
1452024256	Im watching this stream for more then 1 day!
1452024263	i thought zealot charge worked like that in hots?
1452024269	no
1452024271	no
1452024271	Stealthsin, we never got to see what it was like for Anakin to transition from the Light to the Dark by relying more on unleashing his emotions. He was just suddenly evil. Kylo Ren is a good study in what sort of person turns to the dark side. Agreed, Angry_Midget_
1452024273	@Standardpwnage a friend of mine thinks the same way
1452024274	I wish XD
1452024282	no zealots do half damage on charge
1452024285	@Standardpwnage she thinks it was garbage
1452024289	@stealthsin eh, if you think so. I think he's still an interesting character with lots to prove and room to grow in the next two films

1452024323	No the silver storm trooper made no sense
1452024325	i wonder if luke will reveal to kylo that he brought vader to the light at the end
1452024328	Kamakasa, can you give an example of how he made no sense?
1452024329	Lol it was so funny. My brother is GM and he woke up and wanted to play 1 game. And he like" wtf my GM!!!" #thestruggle Lol
1452024331	He made sense
1452024335	Silver Stormtrooper PogChamp
1452024335	I liked the movie quite a bit, but I really disliked the cast
1452024338	just the power difference stuff
1452024339	I just cant understand how could he lose to that bitch girl
1452024342	But still came out lame
1452024346	at the start he stops a blaster shot
1452024348	brienne in my star wars Kreygasm
1452024351	then hes like super weak later on
1452024353	why do these pros know so little about the game they spend every hour playing

1452024363	cant fight the rea rei chick or the black guy
1452024364	@Kamakasa Exactly!
1452024365	That bitch girl is a Skywalker
1452024368	you expect him to be ultra bad ass, but... inside he is just a child that thinks he knows what is good for himself, and he choose the dark side. great character love him

1452024403	Kamakasa, let's be serious--SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER ((((Kylo Ren had just killed his father in a very emotional moment. He was conflicted. In that moment, Chewbacca shot him with the fucking BOWCASTER, which crippled him for the upcoming fight, but he still did pretty well.))) SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER
1452024404	He got shot by chewies blaster, which they spent 50% of the film reminding you how strong it was. He was not 100% when fighting rey
1452024409	Phasma had like two scenes, what was the point
1452024424	kylo ren got beat by a noob
1452024426	lol yeah ive heard that bs argument
1452024431	why are there so many messages on his screen that I dont see? Is he in another chat channel?
1452024439	Truth it gave Ray the chance to show her skills. Her noob skills lmao Jortalus
1452024442	Kamakasa, BS? Do you know what emotions are? Do you know what pain is? Are you even human?
1452024446	^
1452024447	Kamakasa those arent canon
1452024447	he has trained since he was a kid and the chick had never used a light saber
1452024452	LUL
1452024454	Alright, let me lay down some star wars lore for all of you, I have to start with 4-6 and the galactic empire
1452024456	i'll be ecstatic once they recast Fin and Rey
1452024463	nah kylo is great because he is the first dark side chracter that is unsure of himself, and the first time it's shown on the big screens
1452024464	gg
1452024466	this dude has donated like 30 dollars now
1452024470	rekt
1452024471	Kylo Ren got Cheesed
1452024471	@Curtsy Kylo ren aside. The bowcaster "sidestory" was so cringy..them reminding about it every 20 mins
1452024471	immemediately LUL
1452024476	@Kamakasa, She is trained, did you even see the movie? Read between the lines fag
1452024483	@Jortalus, you forget that sith draw power from pain you cuck
1452024488	@Curtsy She wasnt trained was she?
1452024488	Like had 1 week training from yoda and turned into a Jedi knight hahah
1452024488	What's the difference between this chat and destiny .gg???
1452024489	So the entire reason for the empires existence was actually to keep a defense force capable of repelling the star wars equivalent of humanoid tyrannids immune to the force at bay from invading their galaxy
1452024492	han/leia was 100% cringe all around
1452024496	^
1452024498	@stealthsin that scene with Kylo is literally the only reason they kept doing that though
1452024502	Remember how in the 4-6 movies that they never did justify why the empire was evil
1452024505	CUX SwiftRage
1452024507	That was supposed to be a twist for later
1452024509	it was never evil
1452024510	ImalsoAcai, emotional pain, though. Not fucking bloody gapes in their flesh lol
1452024511	Rey could have been trained when she was really young, which would prove why she was left in jaku when she was young
1452024514	@rallyhearts destiny.gg has more memers and combos
1452024520	because all jedi were being persecuaded
1452024520	@Rallyhearts one has autism the other doesnt
1452024523	Destiny.gg is empowered by memes and donations. Here we pretend we are better and there they do the same. So there is none
1452024530	han solo traiined her to be a jedi? wows
1452024530	Wait was Ray trained before they assaulted the "Death Star" Kappa ?
1452024533	Rey was trained when younger, Luke trained a bunch of jedi and Kylo went ape shit crazy and killed them all, Rey was mind wiped to protect her.
1452024536	Kriell, that's called a Retcon.
1452024544	Nah bruh its canon
1452024546	@profmcdougal she was born way after that

1452024548	split lings between high ground and low ground?
1452024548	She was left on Jaku because her parents knew she was a shit character and was hoping starwars wouldnt find her there
1452024549	Curtsy, that can't be confirmed
1452024549	Kriell, it's really not.
1452024552	they just ignored the books to make culture diversity star wars

1452024617	calm down hipster it was a VERY goosd movie

1452024839	Kriell, It shouldn't have killed him to begin with. The whole circumstance was so fucking arbitrary. It's like the author is all "I wanna kill Chewbacca but he's too smart to die in any normal way, so let's come up with all this gravity well bullshit, give the heroes plenty of warning, then come up with something retarded for Chewie to get caught up in and die somehow."

1452025379	who would win a fight between kylo ren and zeratul? Kreygasm
1452025382	It wasn't coruscant it was some other republic planets
1452025382	LittleFaces, to be fair, the movie's execution of the weakness is the same but it's actually a different weakness. The station was ONLY vulnerable while it was preparing to fire. The energy it stole from the sun needed to be contained and regulated by the structure that was destroyed. If it had been destroyed at any other time, it wouldn't have mattered. The planet collapsed because of the energy going wild. That's why rather than 'explode' it just formed into a ball of energy like a new sun.
1452025382	lol wtf
1452025383	gg destiny, with more training you will be able to beat player of this caliber

1452027193	The toss should just build a nexus in destinys base and recall to that
1452027194	^yes according to chat
1452027216	Toss is worse then Zerg on the op scale
1452027218	Lol
1452027231	Their early game is insane and late game is even worse

1452031742	this version of darude is awesome
1452031743	Ive been playing cs for about 11 years now and have payed attention closely to the competitive scene i think the bans are for sure a good punishment showing that esports should be taken seriously even by the players
1452031746	MLG?
1452031751	@Mrell i think it just needs more time to grow, dota2 will always have a place for the moba try-hards but i can definitely see hots taking LoL's place if riot doesn't do anything to change the direction they're going in
1452031759	the LMNOP is such a shady org
1452031761	TBF, it's not Valve's fault but banning pros who compete in Valve sponsored leagues from using gambling sites related to CS:GO wouldn't be a bad move would it

1452034893	is he still playing the zvp game?
1452034894	what
1452034904	its because the protoss had recall that he couldnt do anything
1452034910	Its prolly Thorzain
1452034913	punish etc..
1452034914	Protoss is the technologic advanced race, so forcefield and recal make perfect sense

1452034958	why are memes so meme now? what happened? affecting multiple games
1452034960	Every match most important item
1452034961	protoss just op just take all their units out of the game so they only got zealots left then its fair game
1452034967	@HyRuul you're ignoring the point dude are you even paying attention? it's a shitty ability for a *strategy game* because it takes the strategy out of army movement.
1452034967	what does that circle do?
1452034970	oh man american voices for Asura's Wrath are SO KappaPride
1452034974	why is his drones running away
1452034984	don't mind me, just pasting some desrow http://i.imgur.com/XLTfhPd.png
1452034987	I mean if that comp is unbeatable you just gotta win earlier right
1452034990	they sound like gay little kids compared to the japanese VAs
1452034992	Whats with this lag?
1452034996	^
1452035006	IMO all fat people look the same
1452035007	ill be your gay little kid KappaPride
1452035009	dont think the comp was unbeatable just that everytime destiny caught him he just recalled
1452035010	KappaKingPrime "some"

1452035033	Dakuten its beatable if you have more bases. both slowly lose stuff and trade, but its harder for zer imo
1452035035	probably both
1452035038	the strategy is moving your army when you have recall. you both have to play around it. its a pretty basic concept
1452035039	this music! SwfitRage Fuck yeah!
1452035045	SwiftRage
1452035049	still can't get enough of the scene when Deus stomps Asura's head :P

1452035095	@HyRuul do you think i dont understand the counterplay? im saying it is a shitty ability that makes playing protoss incredibly forgiving. without recall P players would have to have map awareness and when they had their army in a bad position they would lose

1452035137	if you chase him to his base it doesnt matter if he recalls, right?
1452035139	@HyRuul, You sound like a protoss player
1452035151	Destiny may be a douche but he made me remember how much i love infected mushroom
1452035152	Why doesn't he bring an overseer in case of widow mines
1452035154	more mutas??? he needs banes and infestors
1452035156	lol thor

1452035191	such a bad engagement
1452035193	all banes into the thors :D
1452035194	hmm juicy splits
1452035196	oh man dem splits
1452035202	rugglies, except that protoss army costs more than the entire zerg infrastructure in an average game so losing the game to being caught out ONCE by a race with free scouting (creep, overlords) is a 2/10 meme
1452035202	yeah beaverkat
1452035205	Ok i just come from Rotti stream and hes not sure its Thorzain that doing a comeback but Vortix O.o
1452035208	yeah man you definitely sound stable
1452035212	gg
1452035212	@rugglies I mean the Protoss always had recall but I think the real problem is how easy it is to use it
1452035215	What is dis? WoL? :P none of my games goes like that
1452035215	oh man twitch is so great
1452035220	gg
1452035223	gg boys
1452035226	the derping is real
1452035226	this terran is bad
1452035227	ive been watching destiny play this game for years and i still have never played it or have any idea what is happening
1452035239	@KappaKingPrime true but protoss also trades hugely more efficiently than zerg. i don't think that's a complete argument.
1452035239	Destiny gonna get his twitter back or is he permacucked?
1452035242	GG Kreygasm
1452035243	AngelThump
1452035243	@rugglies back in brood war recall would only bring back 12 units compare to Starcraft 2 it's the entire army

1452035260	hell yeah no 4th for you
1452035261	@mar45690 yeah i agree with you completely
1452035264	he play on NA or USA ?
1452035266	GG
1452035268	@Randocchi He knows all the infestor abilities but no game mechanics xD
1452035269	human has a recall ability and it brings back...12? i think its the whole army tho
1452035269	Damn those balings
1452035270	@Randocchi a few things i guess
1452035274	this music is sick
1452035274	falconp007 Vortix? that would mean is is leaving Heroes of the Storm. i thought it was unlikely

1452035461	star wars was shit, plot was so fucking lame
1452035469	^
1452035469	I liked it, but no fucking way is it 8.5/10 on imdb
1452035471	Tfw rewatched one flew over the cuckoo's nest
1452035473	What a movie
1452035475	i thought the martian was ResidentSleeper
1452035476	end of The Martian was such a letdown
1452035482	Star wars was awesome
1452035483	its terrible
1452035488	@KappaKingPrime i think you're ignoring how good shields are, the fact that a lot protoss lategame units are comparably mobile ( keep in mind we mentioned BL)
1452035489	rugglies, consider you have queens from the earlygame with energy built up, can easily make more with just minerals quickly and they're pretty competent at aa
1452035494	Savin Private Ryan
1452035494	hollywierd
1452035494	destiny can you play the "not a new nigga, I knew I had it in me all along, ayyyyy" song?
1452035499	@rugglies personally I think orbiters should come back and make it a early air unit where you have to research for both clock and recall and remove the mothership
1452035500	Destiny what did you think of Mad Max?
1452035502	you went to watch a Hollywood movie, there's only one person to blame for your wasted time
1452035505	Star Wars was OK, it was a fun ride, but it wasn't much more than a soft reboot
1452035506	@rugglies what's ur option?
1452035506	aka Savin Private Damon
1452035507	@KappaKingPrime, and i dont think youve shown that any Z advantage is worth the massive boon that is recall
1452035508	deadpool?
1452035519	did they introduce token black and gay character in SW?
1452035523	diversity
1452035523	@Destiny The Revenant was okay. I would watch Hateful 8 first shit was good imo
1452035530	Someone told me hateful eight was very good!
1452035531	token black check
1452035533	@mar45690 uhh thatd be cool but i think its bad to take too much from BW
1452035535	tarantino makes cool movies yeah
1452035536	i think the actor of han solos son is not very well picked and the fight at the end was really female like :D
1452035547	well yeh
1452035547	he has an eye for that
1452035554	great music
1452035555	@rugglies yeah but better then the current MSC situation
1452035557	that butter face of his
1452035558	Tarantino might be most genuinely fucking nutso fuck in movies
1452035560	he must be female
1452035561	rugglies, of course they're good, I do think the very lategame favors protoss when you get to build your dream meme army. Z gets to their endgame MUCH quicker though, while often able to pressure the P over the course of the game
1452035563	I guess that might be a good thing
1452035575	@mar45690 oh shit if they took out MSC fucking take anything from BW and im cool with it
1452035578	i liked the fights in star wars they weren't retarded like the prequels, just basic duels
1452035580	star wars wasnt bad, but for me they missed so much information about what happened since the last part...
1452035581	SuppysMom thats just how it is, when terran starts the parade push you have to use all your money to win decisively, no money to invest in long term advantage aka pit + pathogen + infestor. Move towards festors or hive slowly
1452035583	that how i meant it... idiot
1452035587	So will DiCaprio kill himself in 2016 after not winning an Oscar again?

1452035598	I hope not he has cute hair
1452035605	cuckatino is over rated as fuck, his moobies are ok, some are good, but the circlejerk for his moobies are retarded
1452035611	@KappaKingPrime so P army wins, but Z gets to some arbitrary benchmark a little faster, thus recall is perfectly fine? i dont think this argument is solid
1452035612	really ?! Tarantino ? out of all the nut jobs this world has wombed you draw the line a Tarantino ?!?!
1452035622	needs more banes
1452035627	Come on now you're fault if you get dragged into the circlejerk

1452035652	the movie didnt let lei do anything
1452035657	rugglies, not if they're dead to your 10pool LUL

1452036167	@Lowreezy, When ladder is locked people can't be demoted or promoted in leagues.
1452036168	dayum, thats a lot of reapers
1452036170	or was
1452036172	ah
1452036178	@lowreezy they locked the ladder by accident (meaning people couldn't advance ranks or rack up bonus pool)
1452036180	GG lol
1452036183	gg
1452036184	but isn't destiny like top 100 and not in jeopardy of losing GM?

1452036928	well just look at the skill set he had
1452036931	7/11 was better but then the one near me closed so i guess it's a wash

1452037065	zvz is the reason i would never play zerg
1452037074	blizzard would make more money if they gave sc to NA or even EU compared to korea, as its easier to get the players through customs as opposes to the Koreans as they have to be not wanted by Kim Jon Shitstain

1452037318	thats the name LOL
1452037326	why the hell does my retareded graphic card keep crashing
1452037331	just saying that blizzard has it established in the user agreement that they have full control over all starcraft2 related content
1452037335	this guy is a brand new streamer
1452037338	Can we talk about TOOL now?
1452037340	is Destiny super buff now, I haven't watched him stream in a long time
1452037353	if by buff you mean a scrawny white nerd
1452037363	then what
1452037365	then ya he's super buff
1452037369	oh
1452037392	Why was he banned
1452037398	he must have a ripped belly at least
1452037408	he has little bar codes
1452037409	ban them all and let @Destiny sort them out
1452037412	pausing so he can throw that stream on the second
1452037413	so why are they going through so much hoops to screw this scene ?
1452037415	Deezo187
1452037416	must be a low grade player
1452037420	this is his first ever stream
1452037421	Why would you ever threaten a corporation on instant media??? How is that not a strictly losing proposition WTF

1452037506	i think destiny is geting rekt
