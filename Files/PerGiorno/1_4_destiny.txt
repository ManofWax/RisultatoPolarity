1451869171	A few months later, she was going through a rather off phase when streaming, and uploaded a youtube video saying she had Leukemia. She said she didn't want to go through any sort of chemotherapy, and live the rest of her life however long it would be happy.

1451869301	@Mattv91 blindly accepting laws is retarded. saying "if you have nothing to hide you shouldn't worry about everything you do being seen by the feds" is one of the shittiest arguments ive ever heard. you're absolutely mentally retarded if you think the gov't has your best interests in mind. i'd tell you to wake up but you're too busy living in a fairy tale

1451874655	But we all know the Mountian Survied

1451874716	i hope more episodes leak
1451874732	Alexslayer30 theres been a leak?
1451874737	i ment
1451874739	last season
1451874742	oh ok
1451874747	first 4 episodes were leaked before they were aired
1451874753	did destiny make the timer?
1451874755	LUL
1451874757	haha i remember watching 4 of them and then waiting a moonth
1451874761	not again
1451874762	isnt the hound dead in the series? in the book he turned into a monk or something
1451874764	fk the leak, the 3 weeks wait sucked balls FeelsBadMan
1451874775	season 5 was worst season by far
1451874791	but the pretty dragon
1451874812	hardhome was good, rest was kinda boring
1451874814	reading book 4 ResidentSleeper
1451874815	Sir Barristan BibleThump
1451874818	s6 should be amazin
1451874818	We have to go deeper....
1451874827	@destiny workshops become important when you start buying later tech gear, sitting there they do nothing, also one or 2 labs is OK if thats your thing, i personally do HARD focus on planes to get more income, then a i tech for gauss weapons, and once i have fancy gear to buy i go hard for many workshops right when i plan to spend big and get the rebate just in time
1451874837	book 4 is the best one to reread, tho, so much stuff in there that's easy to miss
1451874841	Lemmiiwinks i wanted to see him in some epic battle :(
1451874849	AngelThump
1451874856	Gawntlet, Not the death he deserved FeelsBadMan
1451874862	slifeofham was book 4 the one where they went to that graveyard that hinted that the hound was still alive?
1451874865	grade A AngelThump
1451874874	damn nig
1451874879	yeah, clipper
1451874893	It's all because of Skell Never Forget Never Forget BibleThump
1451874895	It goes higher
1451874897	but im pretty sure that's not really a thing? it was just some dude who took his helmet
1451874898	tfw destiny gets better grades than you FeelsBadMan
1451874910	need to fulton the aliens
1451874910	slifeofham yea no joke theres a lot that I missed but I didnt re read, i just read a thread on r/asoiaf and read all the shit I missed EleGiggle
1451874920	I like how he says "commander"
1451874940	@destiny aliens also gain "research points" at a rate of one per day, and a bonus amount for certain UFO missions that you do not mess with by shooting them down or assaulting when landed (this happens even if you do not have a satelite to see it happen) so interceptors both bring in resources AND slow alien growth rate, i find them the strongest investment in LW
1451874940	just said it there lol
1451874946	it was on that screen
1451874957	lol
1451874960	I saw a spoiler about jon dying.. but then it didn't happen when I thought it would.. But then it did so It's allmost like it wasn't spoiled 4Head
1451874960	@destiny it's at the top of the officer training school tab
1451874964	total ranks 22
1451874967	LMFAO
1451874973	lol

1451885410	Zerg is not overpowered lategame. Yes, if you get there with an economy advantage, you have a huge lead - As it should be.
1451885424	viper bomb should probably be tweaked along with the infestor range thing
1451885427	but other than that yeah
1451885447	Did he lose or win?
1451885460	he got destroyed. Those kind of losses are the best to learn from, thoughj.

1451885665	ranked or unranked?
1451885671	i'm saying if you have ultra, broodlord, infestor, viper with corruptor support in legacy your army can't die @xerevgaming .
1451885682	Yes it can. It was proven last game.
1451885682	tldr: i've had 4 and im this close to have a 5th; i dont feel tipsy BibleThump

1451885709	drinking beer to get drunk is a lost cause
1451885714	drink them faster

1451885719	Oh good we're finally back to SC2

1451892014	dang csgo.... :/
1451892016	I'm tempted to try this game
1451892021	is it fun?
1451892029	no
1451892032	@Thxmanny does it look fun
1451892060	so it's not fun?
1451892065	game has great tournaments
1451892075	its not fun
1451892079	its competitive
1451892082	LOL
1451892086	its fun. takes some practice not to be utter shit at it though
1451892097	^ that
1451892098	@Thxmanny if it wasnt fun ppl wouldnt play it
1451892101	I can do that
1451892116	The community is the same as league but with epeen skin waggling too.
1451892126	never played league
1451892193	I'll give this game a shot then
1451892203	@Destiny, fyi careful with the title, twtich admins are sensitive
1451892228	thanks for the input chat
1451892245	csgo is fun, get ready to mute people as you first start playing though
1451892256	why say that?
1451892273	fulkl clip
1451892276	ResidentSleeper
1451892289	you need to reach... level 3.. i think before you can start playing competitive. atleast when i tried to play casual a few months ago there were a lot of mic spammers
1451892317	oh so I can't play this mode that Destiny is playing right away?
1451892321	he pushes every round NotLikeThis
1451892327	you can browse for community servers though, i find those better than the regular valve-hosted ones
1451892337	MrMoerphy, not on dust 2!
1451892344	rank?
1451892345	oh, my bad Kappa
1451892354	MrMoerphy, long a with the awp is his specialty meme
1451892355	yeah this is competitive 5v5, you need to learn the basics in a few other game modes first
1451892386	Ok, so start with casual then? Do you recommend a different mode?
1451892409	casual is basically the same as this but with more people
1451892413	deathmatch is the best for practice
1451892418	then there's deathmatch which is regular deathmatch
1451892428	with near instant respawns
1451892441	should do a combination of both
1451892445	play gungame, casual is horrible
1451892460	do deathmatch for practice with guns? casual for structure?
1451892496	gungame?
1451892512	gun game upgrades your gun every time you kill someone
1451892517	@Destiny when you push every round, youre extremely easy to counter..
1451892523	Leaf a like
1451892529	and whoever goes through all guns first wins
1451892538	that's cool
1451892547	honestly just try all the modes
1451892549	so you get to preview the guns
1451892552	some start with pistols and go to awp or whatever
1451892561	that's what it sounds like TBH
1451892564	others start at awp and go to knife hehe
1451892573	or nade
1451892591	Yeah, I also started playing CSGO recently. Definitely a hard game to learn
1451892592	think matchmaking order is pistols up to snipers and then knife?

1451893882	is there something wrong with this crosshair?
1451893883	i had to bait him in to it though
1451893889	;/
1451893904	the problem is whne ur good, and ur lining up a shot, dynamic crosshari makes it impossible to line up an angle
1451893937	DarKcS not if you put a sharpie dot on the middle of your monitor Kappa
1451893947	u can make ur xhair a dot, Cammyo..
1451893949	the scouts only strat PogChamp
1451893950	so best thing is to do what then?

1451893964	forsenC forsenBoys forsenC
1451893964	without the lines on a crosshari, a dot makes it hard to judge vertically, so i stopped using it

1451931154	why was his twitter suspended?
1451931162	@Robomullet yeah I think so too. If you don't have more than a couple of thousands followers you will probably get permanent banned for something like that

1451931419	Destiny gg
1451931423	AllyofJustice okay so basically Destiny got the impression that I was the leader of some sort of cult that kept downvoting everything he said and shitposting him
1451931434	This is the real chat. Destiny.gg chat is for memesters who want to feel special. OpieOP
1451931437	but that was a half truthm a lot of times it was random people shitting on him and i just joined in

1451934339	@Destiny he is using suppresive fire on you thats why
1451934339	how logical is that
1451934343	Jayyy_ up to date. still stutters :(
1451934345	people need a free tile next to them to fire
1451934348	He doesn't have a shot because his step-out is blocked by the soldier in half cover
1451934349	gotta make you play agressive and rely on rng
1451934350	Xcom has no logic lol
1451934363	and im asking here if i should install this game FailFish
1451934375	xcom is beautiful guys dont bully it
1451934382	@Gawntlet what kind of video card do you have? make sure you check drivers manually from the website rather than trusting the auto-update or check-update from the driver software itself
1451934384	theyre suicide units meant to make you scatter
1451934384	granade those suckers
1451934386	coming that i actualy played those diamonds from 199x year
1451934386	ofc they don't have fear
1451934404	but ayy lamo tho guys every game has flaws FailFish
1451934438	xcom apocalypse has no flaws
1451934461	why doesn't he use the rocket launcher on the support class?
1451934462	could expand that game to 10 size and upgrade graphics and would be best xcom ever made
1451934470	and has real time

1451934494	@MountMarilyn I think the word you're looking for is RTS.

1451934499	granates in this game must have been nerfed, you dont stand that close to an exploding granate
1451934506	well it also had micro managment
1451934524	Well that would leave it without the elements that make it XCom :O
1451934539	which allowed freedom to equip many kinds of weapons, or just overpower ufos just by air power, not even do tactical missions
1451934545	HE grenades are pretty bad on anything that's not an engineer

1451939180	his lagging
1451939182	Sign of a mediocre player, complains about things being out of control at every opportunity, see it with NA players blaming scripts all the time on LoL
1451939201	@Fubick not true. look at neuro :) he hugs ppl win or lose
1451939209	im scared of neuro tbh
1451939218	neuro does get annoyed at times
1451939220	@Eddfir Lol. Who blames scripts?
1451939229	@naltron did you see that video on YT where he fights his alter ego with a keyboard in a forest lmao
1451939238	@Eddfir I mean, if you're playing against a script it's pretty awful.
1451939241	@Hydralinsk no haha where can i find it
1451939246	@Milo109, Bjerg, DL at least, I don't watch NA pros much, too much shitty rap and poor play
1451939254	@Eddfir But I dont think I've ever seen one in a game ive played
1451939256	@Hydralinsk im guessing everyone on that pro gaming house hes at locks their doors to sleep xD
1451939261	i like the guy. but hes scary
1451939276	@Robomullet, Yeh but they literally blame scripts in 1/5 games, 0 chance that proportion of high end players use those
1451939278	@Naltron https://youtu.be/OxOwub95BQ8?t=396
1451939281	NA pros are the worst LoL streamers imo
1451939298	It's super obvious when there is a scripter
1451939301	@Eddfir Who are you referring to? I don't know many pros who do that tbh
1451939308	its fucking crazy how people watch league streamers
1451939313	i dont play this game. but a friend told me that if i know how to play League of Legends this game will be easy to learn
1451939321	They have such a bad attitude, good players always blame themselves when things go wrong because thats the attitude you need to compete
1451939324	someone like dyrus was getting like 30k viewers like what the fuck

1451939337	@Helloimpulse I'd agree
1451939341	yet they get insane amount of viewers
1451939342	It's because of memes dude

1451939398	@Kamakasa, some streamers are good, but a lot just shove in shit music and endless donation cock sucking
1451939398	@Eddfir If you're arguing the Bjergson can't compete, than you're taking the wrong tack
1451939404	hey is dayz good ?
1451939411	no
1451939418	did they added cars yet?
1451939422	@Milo109, He competes fine in NA, not at a world scale. And I was talking in general, Bjerg is a decent midlaner

1451939460	BasedGod
1451939477	idk i played it for like a good year or so and followed the comp scene
1451939484	league of legends is a good game, as long as you don't play or watch it
1451939498	lol
1451939501	League has been improving in quality consistently, the developers are solid, you probably just got bored if you think its gotten worse gameplay wise
1451939505	inb4 destiny bm's agile if he wins
1451939514	are you kidding?
1451939519	the fucking juggernaut bullshit they did
1451939522	and the hud changes
1451939522	agile is a piece of shit
1451939522	I just visited Agile's channel, so much BM and cancerous it's amazing. DO NOT VISIT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

1451939554	The problem with lol its the community.. but like 80% are kids so..
1451939565	If you have a basic understanding of the game design it has now compared to 1-2 years ago then it has improved massively, if you honestly think jugs are OP you dont know how to play the game even half well
1451939569	being bm is pretty funny
1451939574	its all ogre now
1451939576	yeah lol the league reddit is crazy

1451943618	they started as a mock band not sure what you expect
1451943620	10.000 days sucked
1451943624	an enema should be a part of everyones daily hygiene routine
1451943628	being a teen in the 90s, Tool was a great change from grunge. plus the live shows where worth it

1451943713	not sure if you don't tune in that often, but meh
1451943717	Tool is guud morDuck

1451943759	how long is the stream delay?
1451943760	muta v terran? Rip
1451943762	I think he told HBO the story so he wouldn't have to put any effort into writing the books
1451943764	@Traiborn I like SOAD's drummer a lot dont get me wrong, he is not a bad player he has excellent talent, i just think tool's percussionist was better
1451943768	books and show are both Kreygasm but books are more Kreygasm
1451943771	man, gotta scroll through all kinds of games until i get to dead as fuck sc2 Kappa

1451944209	@Dcmccoy Opposite actually, darker skinned people produce more sea balm, their skin naturally moistens due to more skin pigmentation (melanin)

1451944213	i think they are mediocre at best

1451945414	who knows R programmng?
1451945419	thats how this cd goes, very similar all the way. its supposed to tell the story of his mother whom died of cancer
1451945420	Bro dont hate on tool
1451945421	the band is named Tool? wow, how fitting
1451945424	there are some artist, which are pretty monoton
1451945425	wot DansGame BrokeBack FailFish
1451945429	Rosetta Stoned is like only song that sounds remotely different
1451945438	Is it not just an underlying theme they are trying to project? or is that too sadistic?
1451945438	people bitch when a band tries to be different
1451945444	the drummer is pretty good imo
1451945444	good band
1451945445	nearly every guitar-focused band uses the same key for all their songs.
1451945445	@Angrytetris why because it focuses on other mechanics other than spending gold to buy items? bet you couldn't get rank 1 pleb EleGiggle

1451945527	wow the bridge of this song is SO bad, it builds no hype

1451945696	Destiny would make a good beta cuck IMO
1451945710	destiny is arguing with some imagined entity, while i think most Tool fans would agree that the entirety of 10k days is very similar

1451945734	SAYNsh, these guys actually have fans?
1451945734	That's because you didn't pick the best album: Undertow
1451945738	morgasm92, nope, he made his decision before this
1451945739	last time i heard anything off this album was when i was in line with my friends to go see primus,one of the radio stations had this playing on the speakers outside

1451946165	Arabian_Night, i can agree with that, it isn't generic. But i never could listen to more than one album of them in a row.
1451946165	tune in and of course it's a zvz match
1451946169	which says a lot

1451946181	I have to agree with lastigx. This music blows magical unicorns 15ft rainbowy penis....get some real music / metal in this bitch
1451946187	DcMcCoy, theres seriously nothing to discuss, you come across as someone who's already made up your mind. you think theres objectively no merit to music just because it doesnt speak to you.
1451946187	DICEDLEMMING, Kappa //
1451946189	@Arabian_Night, well, maybe you check yourself ^^
1451946190	@EG_IdrA wtf why are you here?!
1451946191	I don't like this song, it is so disharmonic.
1451946192	alright this riff is actually kinda hype, but it doesnt follow up with anything valuable
1451946193	PoE is the best game ever, Destiny should try it out
1451946194	@Thisisacer I think you need to have a certain type of music listening style to like Tool, I know that sounds weird, but I yhink uou do.
1451946199	DICEDLEMMING, how many deaths PEPE
1451946207	@EG_IdrA WTF why are you here ? ? ?

1451946658	most guys here complaining about the music probably listen to generic music. So yeah..
1451946659	Rizcantonai there is a bug in the ladder system where you can leave your league and apparently get placed higher. I'm not exactly sure how it worsk but people are apparently abusing the system
1451946660	Leaving leave gives you GrandMaster MMR, that means destiny loses 20points and that guy gives him 1 point if destiny wins

1451946762	What exploit?

1451946766	don't blame the user blame the dealer
1451946771	@Cobothegreat does it benefit their mmr or simply just the point system
1451946771	unintentional use of game mechanics is exploiting
1451946774	DcMcCoy, its literally impossible to discuss music objectively, short of saying things like "in this song they used X instrument". when the discussion boils down to things that bands have done before other bands objectivity disappears because there is always a chance that theres some that will like the later bands take on it.
1451946777	Rociererer when has he ever been positive or upbeat...

1451946826	DcMcCoy, just because X band wasnt the first who did something like music Y, doesnt mean that people wont like them
1451946837	LegendaryCA, but the riffs in the second part are themost GG
1451946848	he has aids of the vag
1451946849	pretty sure no one died tonight lol, but if you want to compare to that fine
1451946850	if you want a better version of tool listen to porcupine tree
1451946850	TOOL>NA
1451946853	GG
1451946859	Tool does get old after like, two songs :P
1451946859	@LITTLELITE, kinda hard when your playing shit
1451946863	why do people like tool
1451946867	like worship it
1451946870	DcMcCoy, if thats your whole argument then you just come off as a stereotypical elitist hipster
1451946872	porcupine tree has very similar songs aswell
1451946885	Lol, music may be subjective, but musical performance does have objective criteria. There are objectively bad and objectively good musicians out there.
1451946885	because they have simple minds, @SosooMad they are easy to please;\\
1451946886	they worship tool because theyve never heard real music
1451946889	these songs blend together more than Nickleback
1451946889	SosooMad, Tool are like anal fisting. love it or hate it kind of thing
1451946889	beethoven sucks aswell. actually mozart sucks dick. all music is meh. everything sucks beethoven sucks aswell. actually mozart sucks dick. all music is meh. everything sucks

1451946902	Toastmaster7727, whats real music to you
1451946903	pretty nice hold
1451946906	SAYNsh, it actually is much easier than you make it out to be, its not about bands who take inspiration from a certain style, look at how many people covered the ultimate "generic rock" invented by bon jovi, there is so much good songs, but complete disregarding the option to objectively judge art like music, is simply wrong, thats why we have academia on those fields, there is objective comparisons to be made

1451947366	SAYNsh, you are right, art is more subjective than objective, not saying these songs are awful trash so if you enjoy that, go ahead, i know i enjoy some generic shit aswell. also i am not an "intellectual". I'm merely pointing out that this music is in no way bringing much value, nor unique factors to the rock genre, tool is an alright band, i could listen to that occasionally, but objectively, they pale in comparison to truly great bands
1451947367	Saynsh shit music doesn't get published by a label, big or small. It may be subjectively bad once it comes off the recording studio, but that's due to the personal preference you are talking about. Objectively: the lyrics, instrumentation, mix, effects, mastering have all been made objectively good based on objective standards within respective fields.

1451947567	i think there is alot of variety in tools music
1451947568	so why aren't they allowed that? because of what their supposed genre should be? Sounds like your defending them really
1451947569	idk.. but i do know tool is one of the 194 classifications of metal 4Head

1451947721	@destiny what's about infected mushroom?
1451947722	listen to jaya the cat!!!
1451947723	i saw them live and it was intense
1451947724	even A Perfect Circle sounds really similar to Tool
1451947725	riverside got some good songs, but they are also repetitive as fuck
1451947727	@Destiny progressive rock/metal is a very loose genre and tool is definitely progressive in some areas but not others
1451947729	@Destiny, Puscifer is where maynard started to change the sound up a lot Tool was a pretty basic sound because it worked for them
1451947730	So lets forget about the white boys and slap on some 50 cent
1451947734	system of a down: same genre, much more versatile
1451947735	@Sirampr ok sir yes sir
1451947737	holy shit
1451947738	I don't think you'll see this message, but man listen to Haken, in the genre their the best and most enjoyable by far
1451947739	Tool reminds me of Bruno Mars
1451947741	so because you feel like they arent allowed to mix chill and repetition with other stuff you think you are saying they're objectively bad?
1451947743	MASTODON? we power rangers now? Kappa

1451947987	linkin park is pretty bad, its on the same level as nickelback
1451947989	Tool albums are written to be taken as one continuous song that's why Maynard won't put them on streaming services, at least that's what he said

1451950566	yeah a lot of rappists like snoop dogg arent so bad
1451950569	you are right...they already invaded in the late 40s
1451950570	Dark Templars accepted the protoss from Aiur as refugees didnt they? :)
1451950574	What most people from north america fail to realize is that europe is in no way a unity in the same way that the united states are. Pretty much every country in europe speaks a different language, and far from every country in europe is part of the european union. And the european union is not one nation like the united states are. It's more like an economic alliance between countries that has a few shared laws that members of the union can freely choose to opt out of.

1451951529	Will you plebes just stfu about Winter
1451951532	k1ash3r, you are an inspiration. You are not afraid to be flamboyant and admit that you live an alternative lifestyle. I think you are one of the best inbred autists on twitch and you are a great role model. I know some people probably don't understand, but i do.
1451951532	my memes meme themselves
1451951533	@Hashbeansc2, no idea, but i know i envy no man who has to pay for it

1451951546	@KappaKingPrime, thanks
1451951550	@Hashbeansc2 ya if winter even does have a real girlfriend she is obviously a loser if she puts up with him. or she likes money
1451951553	Winter's actually a 'celebrity' that's how fucked up this new media is
1451951560	winter wouldnt get picked on because he's worth more than any of you.
1451951561	you don't require talent to get fame these days
1451951565	yeah that's my point
1451951573	winter pay for pussy? rofl winter gets more pussy than rifkin, he doesnt have to pay for pussy you retards
1451951580	Who's rifkin
1451951580	before you had actual people with talent make it in entertainment
1451951586	now you have people like Winter and youtube stars lol
1451951592	Rifkin wishes he can get zombie grubs pussy EleGiggle
1451951597	Does slayers boxer still play starcraft?

1451951673	THICK THROBBING CUX
1451951674	man destiny sounds like he needs a nap
1451951676	woodenbeem it essentially makes it so if destiny wins he only gets like 2 points but if he loses he loses 25 points
1451951677	Zombie grub doesnt like penis I'm sure

1451951688	DuckerZ
1451951690	winter gets to relevancy by viewbotting, then convinces basically everyone that he viewbots by being blatant enough then gets almost banned for it because it is proven, then nothing happens and winter keeps getting 2k+ viewers and still viewbots and still no one gives a fuck, and hes returned to being featured on front page and tl.net. nice DatSheffy
1451951693	no, that's scarlett
1451951711	zombie thinks she's too good for rifkin. but that nagging itch is the only thing bad on btv
1451951717	hey destiny i hope you're reading this EleGiggle
1451951717	zombiegrub is a little awkward, probably a virgin. would love to get that tight, untouched pussy
