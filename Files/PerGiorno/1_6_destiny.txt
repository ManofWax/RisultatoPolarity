1452040464	throughout my years in the star craft two game i've been in bronze to about high gm. Throughout the time many game styles came and went but there was one in particular that stayed i personally thought was worth keeping around. (IE WoL,Hots, LoV) that one style of game play is in fact mass overlords. Mass overlords is a very high level and challenging style to play because of the hard core micro and critical thinking involved in it

1452040657	with the massing overlords build the goal is pressure enough with the overlords to give you time to max out. some advantages you have going the mass overlord build is because they hover above the groud its very hard for lings to jump and attack them. same as zealots and so on and so on.
1452040663	who is rank #1 now on NA?
1452040664	Foobar2000 is the app
1452040676	with enough overlords you could creep the entire map
1452040684	then the opponent won't be able to build buildings
1452040688	ez gg
1452040691	with enough overlords you'd kill all retard protosses

1452040886	why didnt he surrender hes impossible behind now?
1452040887	@Waynejonbrady Ikr ?
1452040893	but back to the build. Since they cannon be attacked it eliminates all cheese early game and causes the other races to have to tec a lot faster puting you in an advantage. eventually you should be able to snowball with the overlord harass making it a quick and easy GG. but some builds do counter the mass over lords so you have to be very sneaky sometimes
1452040906	@Thantanos, he's not?
1452040908	Destiny, i'm watching your stream while lifting in my home gym. On a scale of 1 to Avilo, how mad are you?

1452041027	this protoss is so cancer
1452041029	this build is a very effective zvz build because most zergs go roaches. see roaches can only shoot their slime not to far so its very very hard for them to tilt their head up and shoot at the overlords. Most of the time they can only hit the overlords 30% of the time. But since your overlords do massive dmg they should be able to clean up the roaches without any problems.

1452041154	JOHN CENA 4Head
1452041156	So is toss the easiest race to play? I want to get started
1452041158	why 2 spires?
1452041161	banlings though are a very highly effective counter because since they can explode they can do a lot of dmg to the overlords bellys. see the over lords bellys are very unprotected. kinda likea hedgehog. but with proper micro you can easily out micro the banelings without loosing your army
1452041162	I always see ppl do that
1452041164	oh look he realized he couldnt fight that army CTRL Z

1452042148	How is destiny such a high rank? What did I miss
1452042153	Maiayenuhs hence someone important had to die
1452042154	Why kill off the only character from the 1st trilogy that is charasmatic and can still act like Han probably because Harrioson Ford is a douche but still
1452042155	Destiny, would you ever skype with Minigun again? That was fun.

1452042523	that was op so they removed it back then but they've wanted to bring something like that back to reapers for a while
1452042531	it was kind of a rehash of new hope, but in all the comics and books the emperor just builds one super weapon after another so it's all a rehash
1452042543	interesting playlist
1452042545	I never messed around with it in campaign. you can't buy every upgrade anyway. especially if u want to beat Kerrigan at the end

1452044239	Saying SC2 is harder than any other game is subjective
1452044244	@oregonkamm23 a dead game would be warhammer 40k dawn of war
1452044251	exactly
1452044255	but the jump from being in gm to competitive is a whole different level

1452044343	it really isnt though
1452044349	I've had a friend get into diamond 4 months into the game
1452044351	its fact
1452044353	Stop being a retarded fanboy

1452044381	diamond is shit yes
1452044382	I was grandmaster when I played
1452044384	Im GM
1452044385	why no gold, destiny dont know meta
1452044388	grandmaster is barely cracking the shell of what the highest level of sc2 gameplay is
1452044388	but then again wenn i look at the na servers i rarely see any good players in gm
1452044391	and grandmaster isnt even good compared to competitive
1452044394	i mean destiny is top 3 atm...
1452044394	i m diamond 2 in league of legend and play like a bronze at sc2
1452044396	were all gm but diamond is shit

1452044405	You don't have to be GM to put into perspective that Diamond, on scale, has nothing to do with the actual skillcap of SC2.
1452044406	Well, the game is dying
1452044411	When you pass Diamond, the actual game begins.
1452044411	Getting GM isn't that hard anyway

1452114371	@curtsy jokes aside, maybe you can get away with saying it is upper middle class. But most people would just consider that upper class. Upper class doesnt just mean people making 200k+ a year

1452114581	they die from coffe
1452114581	SPOILER: i thought that how everybody was evil was kind of a cop out
1452114584	destiny oh my god stop spoiling the movie and play long war
1452114590	There's this mini series called "And Then There Were None", Destiny, it's three episodes long and goes perfectly with what you said, with the Scooby Doo analogy.
1452114595	you drink the coffee and everybody is revieled
1452114600	tell me when he is done talking about htf8
1452114602	It's like, ten people on an island and one of them is killing the rest
1452114602	its closer to a western flick than a murder mystery
1452114604	i thought at first no one was working with the prisoner

1452114853	OnASnowyDay, when
1452114859	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
1452114861	The movie is an anti trope as far as mystery movies go, it takes the "i would just do this" idea movie goers always have, and shows why it wouldn't work in this scenario

1452115832	Destiny how many times can you reset until it isn't your first time anymore
1452115843	@Rangerkaw his ban was only 12 hours which expired like 12 hours ago
1452115849	New xcom?
1452115857	MrHolySh1t, it expired days ago but he's still banned
1452115908	probably overall best bonus is france 40% this tierlist looks odd
1452115913	That's just one guy's opinion on what's an S-tier meme, though.
1452115928	That list is shit. The money you save with the Russian Satellites outweighs the reduction of the one time Officer Training School purchases
1452116012	isnt the best strat for this game satellite rush or something
1452116016	@pacjax so how has ur day been?
1452116021	idk i played on normal so it was easy
1452116023	@MesserSandman, not in long war
1452116031	mar45690, BrokeBack
1452116035	satellite rushing is bad in long war
1452116035	does that answer your question?
1452116041	Sure
1452116068	you see too many ufos for your interceptors to keep up
1452116069	How can anyone watch the same missions over and over
1452116074	France 40% bonus is the overall best bonus, if you want focus on psi, mexico 20% or Argentina +5 will are good.
