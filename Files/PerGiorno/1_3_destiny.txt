1451849939	Some fitness centers dont allow you to do deadlifts
1451849941	can't deadlift without legs FeelsBadMan

1451849974	yeah man I'm on that natty life
1451849989	its a gym not a library
1451850004	I don't deadlift to high risk of damaging my lower back if u arch. I just do more body eights for lower and upper back. It's longer but don't inner myself
1451850010	That lunk alarm shit is only in few american fitness centres
1451850011	Destniy, I have my own gym here at home with a power rack. You have lots of extra space, right? Why don't you just do the same.

1451850055	Proper form fixes that problem with deadlifts, ive heard of a guy hurting his back while doing bicep curls
1451850056	just spraypaint it hot pink

1451850098	its only a game 4Head
1451850106	Weighted dips
1451850117	Well he must be swinging a lot of he hurt his back with curls, there's just a huge risk with hurting urself with deadlifts next to other exercises.
1451850126	I got a nice power rack and bumper plates with olympic bar for about 700 bux.
1451850126	you dont need a full gym, i have a bench, bars and weights and i can do every muscle

1451850217	But on the levels destiny is on testosterone, the amount he will get from diet/excercise is neglible, he needs to get it through other means to be actually show proper results

1451859299	I sexually identify as a spicy memer. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of filling every web page in the known universe with my spicy memes. People say to me that posting memes is a disgusting habit and I'm a horse but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install pepes on my face and 100 dongers on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "spicy memer" and respect my right to fill your browser history with memes.

1451861464	what do those valves that are highlighted do?
1451861478	valves are for council mission
1451861488	Bridge dies if you don't turn the valves.
1451861505	they give out your personal information on christmas
1451861574	cause..valve messed up letting people see personal info of customers... meme failed:(
1451861578	Bench darren
1451861592	he never uses steady shot DansGame

1451861635	steady shot is for wow
1451861636	well I am a shitlord
1451861636	damnit m0m0
1451861638	momo you shitter
1451861643	steady aim adds 20 aim next turn
1451861650	ohh
1451861657	is that a lot in this game?
1451861659	or like a fair bit
1451861666	Momo a shit confirmed
1451861675	all of them for sure
1451861679	wtf LUL
1451861682	it's literally 20%
1451861686	about 2
1451861698	idk how the game mechanics works, i just see dusty be dumb
1451861708	how do you wash your feet in a sink? do you sit on top of it?
1451861709	what is all calculated for hit %?
1451861709	aim is 1/1 for hit chance in this game
1451861715	steady aim is huge for rocketeers, especially at specialist where their aim is awful and they like to rocket themselves in the feet or kill the squad
1451861720	fair enough
1451861729	overwatch has aim penalty
1451861750	this game looks fun
1451861757	at least how destiny plays it
1451861805	i dont have the patience to play the way destiny does
1451861806	dis same as frozen synapse?
1451861813	this game sort of reminds me of darkest dungeon
1451861834	or should i say dankest dungeon
1451861843	No

1451864585	shoots through 4 other teammates - didnt hit anything at all
