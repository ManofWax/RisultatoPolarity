1451689867	the skill in games with RNG is risk management
1451689873	@Celz22, in long war the RNG can be manipulated quite a lot, anyway a lot more than vanilla
1451689877	this is what happens when you have females on your team FailFish
1451689878	he cant fix it, maybe to recconect to obs

1451689940	sound is fine for me
1451689943	@Celz22 the way destiny is playing it is literally RNG and he will lose the game like that. if you actually learn the rules of the game you can reliably win missions without any of your guys taking damage
1451689948	@Celz22 If you don't you get really long and boring fights, and planes that take weeks to repair
1451689952	its because he is playing through his own speakers

1451690558	If a character stands in high cover they will take a step to the right or left of said high cover befor they shoot, then go back behind the full cover.

1451690566	@Destiny try to rush it
1451690568	Nope if the alien moved your character had overwatch on so at the very least you would have got off a shot

1451693704	He definitely isn't forced to play LoL
1451693723	He would keep the views if he played another game?

1451693794	destiny that hair length is a good look on you btw

1451694139	@DeandreT, I know you can still have a chemical imbalance, but money opens so many doors that you can deal a lot better with depression than when you're poor.
1451694150	is he cucked yet?
1451694151	btw this game is fun just not on impossible PEPE
1451694155	This game is adequate at what it tries to do, but I don't like at all what they did to the classic X-Com formula
1451694175	i rate this game 2 out of 10
1451694177	What are the differences @kreegath ?
1451694178	lw impossible is really unfair
1451694179	That`s what i call chemistry zo.gd/9RKmK Kappa
1451694188	There are huge differences Swiftbro
1451694194	for example?
1451694198	@Kreegath have you tried xenonauts?
1451694209	The tactical aspect of the original games have been replaces with action elements
1451694217	mods dont even delete sketchy links

1451694303	yes
1451694305	Yeah therapy is expensive as fuck and it's really hard to actually want to invest that money in trying to fix your situation when you're depressed. It's pretty much impossible to do when you can barely pay rent.
1451694305	M3gaBlue, they have every kind of snack pls

1451694428	There's also no overworld, Swiftbro. The freedom you had in the original games have been streamlined to only allow you one progression path. There's no overworld, or base building, or economy management like in the old games, no ufopedia or customization of your teams. Those were things I loved about the original games
1451694451	i didnt realize the stream was going to literally be the first time through long war over and over Kappa

1451694523	This games isn't about sci-fi/horror, it doens't try to be like the first and second X-Com, so it's understandable that it doesn't contain the game elements of the originals

1451694602	@kreegath sounds interesting but I'm too lazy to pick up the older games because I'm an asshole and the old graphics are making me less interested
1451694625	Destiny are you actually going to award t4 and t3 sub to the winner and runner up of rustlemania? or is spiders94 doing that
1451694638	That's fine, Swiftbro. The old games are far from perfect

1451695236	naahh just normal im just learning the game. i know hes doing it the hard way :D
1451695238	is this the same map as the 99% xcom meme from 3 years ago
1451695260	he hasn't accepted the true reality yet. But he's getting there. Damage is fine now, just no deaths. Soon we get to the "only two guys dead so it's fine" :D
1451695263	Won't complain if he used Second wave options to make it a tad easier
1451695324	if only he had the option on where you can see the aliens' chance to hit
1451695328	second wave just allows you to bring in more dudes right?
1451695358	second wave has tons of options, that's one of them
1451695361	Aliens? restart
1451695367	@Destiny make your most revealing move first. Keep the squad together. Overwatch everyone as the last action of your turn, not the last action of the soldier so everyone at least gold move

1451708101	i thought medics were good in this game
1451708107	Stormraught just subscribed!
1451708132	wtf is he not russia?
1451708137	hes not russia
1451708140	GGWP NORE

1451708217	i just watched the female streamer debate thing between you and skymp3, and ur a fucking genius
1451708220	he is russia, just the wrong russia KappaRoss
1451708291	this game is hardest right at the start
1451708319	difficulty doesnt keep up once you get armors, or at least its not as bullshit random ded
1451708335	like first 2 terror missions make or break original game run
1451708339	Damn this is kinda really boring
1451708371	not enough memes ResidentSleeper
1451708380	@Destiny you'll have problems with the drones with an all carbine squad, the shotgun helps a lot tho
1451708409	does Xcom have like a endless / sandbox / not story mode?
1451708428	5 by 5 is radio talk, it means good signal essentially
1451708438	Drones have DR - damage resistance. You won't do enough damage when you hit
1451708443	Just get XJ9 out of there safely. He's got a pony at home waiting.
1451708532	get those toss bastards
1451708539	Yes it's a LW thing - although these are baby drones, only 1 DR
1451708576	you can try the assault - run and gun
1451708593	rip
1451708611	that was weird
1451708614	RNJESUS
1451708626	Shotgun is more affect by DR than any other weapon type
1451708637	also developing two squads is essential in long wat

1451709799	Can literally sprint up to him and 100%
1451709868	but then he is exposed
1451709873	Will Destiny be uploading his play through of the game to Youtube after he completes it?
1451709909	Where did he go :(
1451709947	Places

1451712185	everyone needs to be moderated. You need to know that there are people out there with more power than you and are generally better than you as well
1451712187	WutFace
1451712190	@Popohad, whats PM
1451712212	what was destiny expecting from rtba lol
1451712218	Project M, a brawl mod that is pretty much not being worked on any more due to threat of nintendo action
1451712221	fire that 9 miss guy
1451712242	that seems weird that nintendo would give a shit about that
1451712246	but they still let pokemonshowdown exist
1451712251	i guess pokemon is gamefreak tho
1451712256	is RTBA british and black?
1451712261	spooky position
1451712262	I thought pokemon was pokemon company
1451712274	DansGame
1451712275	a subsidiray of Nintendo co
1451712280	But in any case the devs stopped working on PM, and it doesnt get in big tournaments any more
1451712299	Well very much. Also Twitch is trying to kill it too apparently so they had to go to hitbox
1451712310	It is a big conspiracy
1451712312	NotLikeThis
1451712323	what game are we talking abt?
1451712327	PM
1451712331	hell yeah dad playing one of my favorite games!
1451712341	oh i guess game freak, nintendo, and some other company all own shares in the pokemon company and that company does copyright stuff
1451712342	so complex
1451712346	i mean, no streaming site is going to want to host a game mod that is in active litigation, or is being threatened with it
1451712347	is that .4^10?
1451712351	It's amazing how the Aliens have started to flank Destiny and he's still somehow alive
1451712356	does steady shot last only one turn?
1451712358	no conspiracy, just business
1451712360	Hi Destiny, I like your jacket today.
1451712401	pokemon showdown is crazy good, 11k~ concurrent users, has assets right from pokemon games
1451712406	somehow not shut down FeelsGoodMan
1451712418	Is that the online battle thing?
1451712422	yea
1451712436	I want some of these super bullets that can go through earthen terrain
1451712467	oh god
1451712468	rng is cruel tho
1451712469	threw?
1451712470	hes in deep
1451712471	thats just regular bullets
1451712487	Dont you have to reload
1451712490	I just joined, and see paint, this is good
1451712491	The focus fire is good for rockets
1451712521	It' hard to understand Destiny with his pre-school handwriting I'll do my besst
1451712524	the boost would have to be better than double your chances to hit
1451712534	murdaDeez murdaDeez murdaDeez murdaDeez
1451712535	LOOL
1451712540	wtf where are the headphones
1451712546	Its better... why? Well, because. Kappa
1451712556	it is about a .01% chance to miss 10 40%s in a row I think right? .4^10
1451712574	DJ_Cred, he prefers the audio fidelity of the speakers built into his monitor
1451712576	I guess if you dont have a shot you can steady instead of overwatch
1451712578	that math seems solid, but the situtation on the ground might be different... felxibility is better
1451712584	@Destiny Does streaming sufficiently support you monetarily?
1451712600	they could of saved alot of money designing this lvl if all you needed to do was stay in one spot
1451712601	obviously
1451712608	How far into the game is he?
1451712619	theres overwatch aim penalty still right?
1451712626	not far at all Swooped
1451712640	turbo cucked
1451712645	it's .001 chance to miss 10x in a row at 40%
1451712654	wow
1451712666	and?
1451712676	will destiny actually be able to complete a run of this game?
1451712678	asap
1451712679	no
1451712680	thats not really how probability works, but whatever
1451712682	Kappa
1451712695	if you miss 9x in a row the next hit is basically 100%
1451712700	Kappa
1451712700	there is like zero probability of him beating this game
1451712701	@Destiny your math is right, but here, you only need to hit one shot, also, usually you have multiple turns to prepare, and a single turn of decisive engagement, rest is mop-up. Assuming of course that you don't go for the outsider first pulling in all the enemies on the map at once.
1451712703	what is longwar?
1451712715	Destiny's full run of a game is 85%
1451712725	Long War is an XCOM mod that makes everything tedious and boring but calls that "challenge"
1451712740	still cant believe he didnt finish the witcher 3
1451712742	people will forget all about it in a month when XCOM2 comes out

1451712803	weow those injuries
1451712830	the developers of xcom said that long war is better then their original game and they'll be including more tools for xcom 2 so i imagine we'll see longwar 2
1451712840	can't you cut off your characters head in this game and put them in a gundam?
1451712852	what
1451712863	Max injury in the later months is 55 days xD
1451712874	yeah
1451712879	thats like half dead
1451712889	you cant see him
1451712906	is this the Long War mod?
1451712907	Maiayenuhs yeah in enemy Within you can, doesn't seem like he's playing with that though
1451712916	destiny which 4chan board will spawn the big meme of this year?
1451712928	Long War has some great ideas and mechanics but its playability is wrapped in so much tedium... its certainly not for everyone
1451712947	noobsquad
1451712953	What second wave options does he have?
1451712967	Is that a *** she looks like she's packing that long dick?
1451712979	What does long war change?
1451712985	Never tried it
1451712985	Everythinf
1451713016	High cap mags, triggered
1451713027	is this a disney song?
1451713041	look at that beard I bet that guy is a Dank Memer
1451713071	OuO
1451713109	Are those new pillows on Destiny's couch? I think it's a safe bet he didn't buy them
1451713131	thats the good thing about having a girl they buy comfy shit
1451713150	I bet he doesn't even appreciate it
1451713153	yeah but they wont let you sit on the dang pillows...
1451713153	Long war change a lot (More equipement diversity [especially early on], more diversified pods, more/bigger pods per map, 8 classes instead of 4, 8 mec classes, start with 6 man squad, leader mobs, more complex/difficult air combat, economy more build around request/gray market than satellite coverage, reworks of explosives, ...)
1451713161	haha
1451713191	Make way for the queen's guard! SwiftRage
1451713224	basically if you wanted to run XCOM as an actual government beaurocracy, Long War is for you
1451713233	you ain't no alien bruhv!!
1451713242	I hope destiny plays darkest dungeons when the full game comes out i loved watching him play it the last time
1451713247	Yeah I just like watching XCOM. Not the biggest fan of long war, not sure all the things they added are necessary. Wider variations in damage on top of variations to hit irks me a little. Air Combat also got to be more of a crapshoot. I get that the air game was a bit shallow to start with but not sure I like how long war handled it
1451713276	still a fun mod, great work all around so Kappa // to the team
1451713277	remember fish ai?
1451713278	a lot of thigns are just change for change sake, tbh
1451713282	yes
1451713301	tedium = length = challenge
1451713312	not true
1451713318	FF tactics mod is a good ex
1451713322	its not that much more tactically deep, though i do like the new classes
1451713328	not more tedious, just more strategy
1451713329	FF tactics CoolCat
1451713338	That's the real memes
1451713339	The game looks fun but not worth $80
1451713358	@Fear_Silence, youre right, it's worth 100 Kappa
1451713366	this game is not $80
1451713382	Wait is this not xcom 2?
1451713394	is it february?
1451713397	XCom 2 isn't out until February

1451713416	If they are being serious they don't fuck around with threats
1451713425	You can actually custom a lot of things in long war, for exemple I totally nerfed the air game (less repair time/ purchase cost for interceptor), slightly upped minimum stats for rookies, greatly reduced injury times (from 55 to 15), removed increased fatigue from officer/psi, ...
1451713427	oh okay
1451713433	what did a guy say?
1451713433	how do people come to a stream and not even know what game is being played? its listed at the top! and in the title!
1451713442	so I would like to talk about how my family members screwed up bringing pizza to my house today. Since I made dinner for New Year's Eve they wanted to help and bring something to eat for New Year's Day. I suggested pizza and told them where to go. They called me at 3:30 to tell me they were picking up the pizza. Fast forward to 5:00 and they show up and then we eat cold pizza. Btw the pizza place is 5 minutes from my house.
1451713445	You can even change the skill tree if you want I think.
1451713446	Yeah Coldparadox for sure
1451713462	well I ve been watching destiny for years but im not a fan of xcom
1451713478	@MaiAyeNuhs, cant think of anything i care about less

1451714773	I like long war, don't think it's boring. Its like a long game of risk
1451714778	Cause he's playing ironman impossible
1451714782	On long war
1451714792	So of course he isn't going to get any progress

1451714886	first result is nexusmods
1451714888	Type in long waenmod
1451714888	tornis and others who have beaten long war impossible ironman say its kind of like vanilla ironamn
1451714888	go there
1451714890	Ye

1451761142	it should
1451761151	you cant determine it, its based on environmental damage
1451761157	yes it should
1451761168	but it will almost certainly destroy the desk
1451761177	why do none of these building have roofs Kappa
1451761180	centre of the blast is more effective, but until I get sapper I never trust it

1451761241	actually I think you need a sapper with explosive damage perk to destroy objects in LW or rocketeer
1451761269	wrong Fuyocouch
1451761275	It just makes it way more likely
1451761281	well sooooorryyy

1451761315	FailFish
1451761330	damnit destiny why do you make me want to play this game again
1451761345	its based on environmental damage Fuyocouch
1451761373	LW has less environmental damage, need sapper perk to deal decent demolition
1451761373	its probably expired
1451761374	desk was on the edge of the radius of the explosive so received a fraction of the damage from the grenade
1451761382	ah right
1451761386	thats true about getting meld by beating map before it expires

1451762937	Lol
1451762937	have he survived for more than 2 missions yet?
1451762937	more engineer = lower cost satellite

1451762950	but its german engineers
1451762967	isnt that even better?
1451762979	@Destiny veal scallopini
1451762986	It's not worth it... you would get the return on investment over a loooong time... there are better things to do with the $100.. i.e. to stay alive
1451763005	lol what the fuck do you even do with money that early
1451763011	he cant build anything yet
1451763017	put a satellite over your moms house so we can watch her at night
1451763019	@Destiny if you send a satellite over a country without request you just get the montly income, with a request it's an extra bonus
1451763020	he should satellite
1451763029	the month is long as hell, dude.

1451763203	He's played XCOM I/I before, but it's been over a year or so.
1451763205	Destiny, what would they do with a satellite when they don't have the technology to use them?
1451763207	LUL
1451763213	Ya its the reason why a day later and we are on the same mission
1451763216	It's not like he's never done ironman impossible before
1451763220	lol

1451763286	RIP
1451763287	actually, you can check how many engineers you would get for an actual workshop instead of a request and then compare the price of the satellite and the workshop to see if it's worth it.

1451765625	Lone Wolf if you just want to waste a perk. Dead Eye if you want your Sniper to be able to do anything.
1451765626	Sniper is extreme long range. Lonewolf is perfect.

1451765720	Lone Wolf, for when you really want your Sniper to get into auto-asphyxiation.
1451765728	@C0lex I have one, it's not better but it's also not worse
1451765733	so what skill gives him the best chances to get 360 noscopes?
1451765733	lone wolf is the best choice here
1451765734	cmon 7 tiles is not that far
1451765736	yeah c0lex get a macbook pro and some beats headphones breh
1451765762	He's not always way in the back though, low profile would have been good second half of last mission

1451766462	NO
1451766463	it makes your shit harder to hit
1451766464	No, because you don't need a scope/armor if you tilt the situation in favor of you landing, or never being hit. Aliens can't shoot you in obscured cover, and a point-blank shotgun isn't going to miss.

1451774921	outside of college they care about money more than all of that
1451774926	@typeid you need a job, you need to make money for yourself, start building your life up, and in the process you'll eventually find a person compatible with you by being open to new things.

1451775202	@typeid if you perform good in school, you will potentially shorten the period you spend there, and in turn you will get to the next step more easily.

1451775889	lmao
1451775892	the cat died, RIP in pieces
1451775897	it didnt die lol
1451775898	she said she did it so the cats claw wouldnt get ripped out
1451775899	Why send 1 at a time!?
1451775899	she was trying to remove the claw
1451775899	i think that cat was just sick of her shit
1451775902	lol
1451775903	ha haha
1451775903	idk anything about cats so idk
1451775904	YOUR PILOTS SUCKS
1451775904	you can't know for sure from just that video, but yes it seemed sketchy
1451775907	lol
1451775917	you're staying til you fucking die.. rgr that commander :(
1451775921	ITS DOWN BOYS
1451775937	Might make it past the first month.
1451775938	most cats don't like to be held like that and would have responded the same way regardless of "choking"
1451775939	WOW
1451775940	Why the fuck can you only send one interceptor at a time?
1451775942	This is what you guys have done.
1451775943	if aliens were real would trump deport them from earth?
1451775944	i'm not defending her, just saying
1451775945	yeah i saw it also destiny and his gf was like choking that poor cat
1451775947	i think shes full of shit about the claw, maybe she was choking it without realizing it but if you focus on the cat you can tell it is in a visible struggle
1451775950	Easier difficulty, pls.
1451775950	its just a fucking cat why do people even care about this after like 3 days
1451775953	HOW MANY SORTIES DOES IT TAKE TO SHOOT DOWN AN UFO?
1451775957	I choke puppies in my spare time, with my dick
1451775959	she said she needed to show him whos boss or whatever
1451775968	twitchRaid HIROSHIMA WAS AN INSIDE JOB twitchRaid
1451775970	twitchRaid twitchRaid twitchRaid twitchRaid
1451775971	because hurting animals really pisses people off?
1451775971	what up, did I miss the train wreck yet Kappa
1451775983	time to go to d.gg
1451775984	i mean you dont see it with your eye, but you feel it
1451775985	Cherry, if a cat is in a visible struggle it is much more apparant
1451775986	if you look closely at the video, the claw is in her arm at one point, but then the cat removes his paw and she does the thing that people observe as choking
1451775990	Your Mom was an inside job Kappa
1451775997	Grrrrrr
1451776003	hurting cats and dogs does, because most people have very fond memories and interactions with these domesticated animals
1451776007	she was holding the cat down and trying to remove the claw why wont u take her word for it but believe her about showing whos boss
1451776008	also cats can get pretty pissed without being choked
1451776024	@EnvyUK, not when it's being suffocated
1451776041	holy shit, people are going crazy over poor density accidentally causing minor discomfort to a cat.
1451776045	This chat reminds me of Reddit, oversensitive SJWs everywhere whose lives are so fucking meaningless that a cat being strangled is worth talking about for 3 days
1451776049	@Cherrysun, are you kidding, it would be much more apparent if it was actually being choked
1451776054	Time for game of throws
1451776057	why don't you guys just shut up about some retarded titty streamer holy shit
1451776059	WE DID IT REDDIT
1451776068	do people start flipping out when they are being choked?
1451776077	Haha yes
1451776077	cherry, i once saw a video of a guy smashing a dog with a stone brick, the dog screaming and wheezing. this video was quite mild, you can't be sure of what she did
1451776078	no
1451776079	nah, it slows your system down hardcore when you cant get air
1451776081	I think the whole cat strangling situation wouldnt have been such a big deal if she didnt make stupid tweets afterwards
1451776082	she grabbed the cat slightly wrong and it scratched her...thats all...BUT since this is the internent everyone needs to get out their pitch forks and get HER BANNED
1451776082	a cat would fuck your shit up before it starts getting strangled get real
1451776083	same with cats
1451776084	They like being choked
1451776088	if only you had infantry guys
1451776105	cattybatty
1451776106	Anything being choked against it's will flips out in a big way
1451776113	^
1451776114	So she is cat hitler, we get it ResidentSleeper
1451776118	and it did, it tried to bite her and scratch ehr
1451776120	You can't even choke a cat. They literally have nine lives.
1451776122	she basically just dug her own grave while digging herself out of the situation
1451776122	Wait I saw all this referencing to choking a cat... is that a new euphemism for jerking it?
1451776129	^@cruch
1451776130	view, yes
1451776131	You enter a fight or flight mode and your whole body will spasm to find air
1451776131	EXTERMINATE THE JE....CATS!
1451776139	stop talking about it already, and the idiots who say "omg these sjw" shut up aswell
1451776141	You do not calmly pass out
1451776147	you guys still talk about dat cat xD
1451776149	any of you ever saw a corpse?

1451849888	Once you get your body proportions right (ie fat:muscle ratio), it'll impact your testosterone positively.
1451849913	Ah, ok. Looool I went on fb, came back and...yeah...
1451849915	VAC
1451849919	just lift consistently
1451849938	> squating in smithmachine
1451849939	Some fitness centers dont allow you to do deadlifts
1451849941	can't deadlift without legs FeelsBadMan
1451849942	just pack on some muscle nerds 4Head
1451849947	And that is a reason to find a real gym
1451849952	MultiX_GG, why the fuck not?
1451849963	Because of noise that disturbs other customers
1451849973	wow thats gay as fuck
1451849974	yeah man I'm on that natty life
1451849989	its a gym not a library
1451850004	I don't deadlift to high risk of damaging my lower back if u arch. I just do more body eights for lower and upper back. It's longer but don't inner myself
1451850010	That lunk alarm shit is only in few american fitness centres
1451850011	Destniy, I have my own gym here at home with a power rack. You have lots of extra space, right? Why don't you just do the same.
1451850015	don't some vitamin/mineral deficiencies affect it too

1451850042	do you think traps have low T levels because they're traps or they're traps because they have low T levels
1451850052	Destiny, just put it in a garage if you have one
1451850055	Proper form fixes that problem with deadlifts, ive heard of a guy hurting his back while doing bicep curls
1451850056	just spraypaint it hot pink
1451850072	gym at home is the dream
1451850098	its only a game 4Head
1451850106	Weighted dips
1451850117	Well he must be swinging a lot of he hurt his back with curls, there's just a huge risk with hurting urself with deadlifts next to other exercises.
1451850126	I got a nice power rack and bumper plates with olympic bar for about 700 bux.
1451850126	you dont need a full gym, i have a bench, bars and weights and i can do every muscle
1451850136	he has 1 health
1451850139	throw some pistols at it
1451850149	OMG alchemist hit a shot

1451850201	@Destiny, I set mine up for the sole reason that the only gym near me requires me to wait for these annoying fucks to finish with their curls in the squat rack before I can do anything
1451850217	But on the levels destiny is on testosterone, the amount he will get from diet/excercise is neglible, he needs to get it through other means to be actually show proper results

With no way to know which site had a missile in it at any given time, the Soviets would be forced to target them all."

People say to me that posting memes is a disgusting habit and I'm a horse but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install pepes on my face and 100 dongers on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "spicy memer" and respect my right to fill your browser history with memes.

1451864214	the story of XCOM is actually that you lose against the invasion.
1451864218	He is not reliable without sapper, AP is much more reliable damage on non lcpl engineers
1451864232	gives a rocketeer grenades instead of more rockets

1451864566	does destiny ever use suppression
1451864567	its so good
1451864585	shoots through 4 other teammates - didnt hit anything at all

1451869586	@Mattv91 it would be one thing if the tests were legit as to if someone was actually intoxicated or not. but it's stupid that someone could have smoked weed 2 weeks ago and will still trip a blood test. the thc in their system isnt going to do anything to impair them yet the blood test is still going to show that their under the influence. mandatory blood tests are litteral autism until they can perfect the method

1451874602	at*
1451874620	Res Ygritte while you're at it AngelThump
1451874620	in the book he didnt even kill his daughter
1451874620	it's incredibly weird. They wouldn't miss out on the chance to show one of the most loved/hated character brutally die. got thrives on viewer tears
1451874620	Thoros brought back Dondarion like 4 times lmao!
1451874620	The guy that got practially cut in half?
1451874623	That was nuts lol.
1451874636	^^
1451874641	@PoshlyDressedViking, they can cover it up like if people are on a ship, they won't say the captain died, but they can say the ship went up in flames
1451874643	very
1451874655	But we all know the Mountian Survied
1451874657	so it can be assumed that the captain is dead, but it isn't specifically stated

1451874710	@destiny you NEED a 2x3 block of workshop adjacency (not just worksops) bonuses to be able to afford later game weapons and gear, RESOURCES is the limiti for growth in LW and workshop rebate bonus is what saves you this (and interceptors are your "drones" bringing in more resources)
1451874716	i hope more episodes leak
1451874732	Alexslayer30 theres been a leak?
1451874737	i ment
1451874739	last season
1451874742	oh ok
1451874747	first 4 episodes were leaked before they were aired
1451874753	did destiny make the timer?
1451874755	LUL
1451874757	haha i remember watching 4 of them and then waiting a moonth
1451874761	not again
1451874762	isnt the hound dead in the series? in the book he turned into a monk or something
1451874764	fk the leak, the 3 weeks wait sucked balls FeelsBadMan
1451874775	season 5 was worst season by far
1451874791	but the pretty dragon
1451874812	hardhome was good, rest was kinda boring
1451874814	reading book 4 ResidentSleeper

1451874818	s6 should be amazin
1451874818	We have to go deeper....
1451874827	@destiny workshops become important when you start buying later tech gear, sitting there they do nothing, also one or 2 labs is OK if thats your thing, i personally do HARD focus on planes to get more income, then a i tech for gauss weapons, and once i have fancy gear to buy i go hard for many workshops right when i plan to spend big and get the rebate just in time
1451874837	book 4 is the best one to reread, tho, so much stuff in there that's easy to miss
1451874841	Lemmiiwinks i wanted to see him in some epic battle :(
1451874849	AngelThump
1451874856	Gawntlet, Not the death he deserved FeelsBadMan

1451874874	damn nig

1451874895	It goes higher
1451874897	but im pretty sure that's not really a thing? it was just some dude who took his helmet
1451874898	tfw destiny gets better grades than you FeelsBadMan
1451874910	need to fulton the aliens
1451874910	slifeofham yea no joke theres a lot that I missed but I didnt re read, i just read a thread on r/asoiaf and read all the shit I missed EleGiggle
1451874920	I like how he says "commander"
1451874940	@destiny aliens also gain "research points" at a rate of one per day, and a bonus amount for certain UFO missions that you do not mess with by shooting them down or assaulting when landed (this happens even if you do not have a satelite to see it happen) so interceptors both bring in resources AND slow alien growth rate, i find them the strongest investment in LW
1451874940	just said it there lol
1451874946	it was on that screen
1451874957	lol
1451874960	I saw a spoiler about jon dying.. but then it didn't happen when I thought it would.. But then it did so It's allmost like it wasn't spoiled 4Head

1451885255	It sounds like "Toe" a japanese mathrock band
1451885257	idk what song thoguh
1451885274	Naw it's Avilo he is tilted about Zerg Mina
1451885275	the song is in funny talk i cant read that
1451885283	ÔuÔ
1451885304	!momolewds
1451885334	does anyone actually like avilo? he seems so immature and annoying
1451885342	@cute_sc2 i Think z is also favoured in lategame generally, its what they gonna nerf but Most People complaim about ravagers etc what is clearly not op
1451885359	funny talk LUL
1451885363	lol its actually pretty balanced
1451885367	i just hate when destiny whines

1451885398	Zerg lategame is not op, its favoured. Its a bis difference
1451885406	Big
1451885407	does anyone know what that last song was
1451885409	avilo viewbots doesnt he
1451885410	Zerg is not overpowered lategame. Yes, if you get there with an economy advantage, you have a huge lead - As it should be.
1451885424	viper bomb should probably be tweaked along with the infestor range thing
1451885427	but other than that yeah
1451885447	Did he lose or win?
1451885460	he got destroyed. Those kind of losses are the best to learn from, thoughj.
1451885460	he lost
1451885470	Oh I see
1451885475	what a bullshit build though, hellbats wm drop into double lib
1451885481	like all the terran cancer into one build
1451885483	its definitely strong lol @xerevgaming ultras buffed to 8 armor? Broodlords buffed to 11 range? Infestiors buffed? Vipers given viper bomb? And colossus nerfed
1451885490	does anyone know what that last kanye song was
1451885492	1m gigaaaaaaa: 75% = past text
1451885499	colossus were the backbone of the hots deathball
1451885502	thanks obummer
1451885508	get 6 colossus in hots they kill everything lol
1451885509	Destiny, you have good taste in music I think – can you explain why you think Kanye is good? His voice always sounds bad to me...
1451885512	now they suck xd
1451885513	death note ay
1451885520	kanye west is a god
1451885526	@Cute_SC2 if you're talking about protoss, don't get me started, because their earlygame became SO MUCH stronger that getting to the lategame unscathed is a goddamn miracle.

1451885571	Destiny composes all his music himself
1451885577	he missed his 3rd
1451885579	aww maybeshewill <3
1451885585	fuck you destiny bot, cuck fuck piece of shit

1451885596	someone help me
1451885598	mmmm
1451885599	Cute_SC2 you have to realise the "lategame" isn't an even state. If you come to the lategame with same bases as Zerg as Protoss, Protoss is -easily- favored.
1451885600	im drunk af and need help

1451885607	lol kek @Traiborn

1451885648	7
1451885649	30
1451885650	3
1451885653	7 beers is too many
1451885655	4
1451885660	You mean a mmaxed Zerg army with broodlord/infestor/corruptor/Queen - Something which protoss in the last game proved can be beaten with Tempest, Archon, Immortal Storm.
1451885665	ranked or unranked?
1451885671	i'm saying if you have ultra, broodlord, infestor, viper with corruptor support in legacy your army can't die @xerevgaming .
1451885682	Yes it can. It was proven last game.
1451885682	tldr: i've had 4 and im this close to have a 5th; i dont feel tipsy BibleThump
1451885682	and yeah if you have queens transfusing as well
1451885689	caitlynboner
1451885691	Its nowhere near as onesided as you seem to believe.
1451885693	@xerevgaming, destiny didnt hav ethe right comp lol
1451885693	drink3 more
1451885709	drinking beer to get drunk is a lost cause
1451885714	drink them faster
1451885715	depends on time its taken to drink those beers
1451885719	Oh good we're finally back to SC2
1451885719	@xerevgaming, if they go pute tempest you get ultras to push back the HT and spam corruptors and a coupel vipers
1451885722	go watch snute
1451885724	@Cute_Sc2 Destiny was on 6 bases and was gas starved. What more do you want.

1451892029	no
1451892032	@Thxmanny does it look fun
1451892060	so it's not fun?
1451892065	game has great tournaments
1451892075	its not fun
1451892079	its competitive
1451892082	LOL
1451892086	its fun. takes some practice not to be utter shit at it though
1451892097	^ that
1451892098	@Thxmanny if it wasnt fun ppl wouldnt play it
1451892101	I can do that
1451892116	The community is the same as league but with epeen skin waggling too.
1451892126	never played league
1451892193	I'll give this game a shot then
1451892203	@Destiny, fyi careful with the title, twtich admins are sensitive
1451892228	thanks for the input chat
1451892245	csgo is fun, get ready to mute people as you first start playing though
1451892256	why say that?
1451892273	fulkl clip
1451892276	ResidentSleeper
1451892289	you need to reach... level 3.. i think before you can start playing competitive. atleast when i tried to play casual a few months ago there were a lot of mic spammers
1451892317	oh so I can't play this mode that Destiny is playing right away?
1451892321	he pushes every round NotLikeThis
1451892327	you can browse for community servers though, i find those better than the regular valve-hosted ones
1451892337	MrMoerphy, not on dust 2!
1451892344	rank?
1451892345	oh, my bad Kappa
1451892354	MrMoerphy, long a with the awp is his specialty meme
1451892355	yeah this is competitive 5v5, you need to learn the basics in a few other game modes first
1451892386	Ok, so start with casual then? Do you recommend a different mode?
1451892409	casual is basically the same as this but with more people
1451892413	deathmatch is the best for practice
1451892418	then there's deathmatch which is regular deathmatch
1451892428	with near instant respawns
1451892441	should do a combination of both
1451892445	play gungame, casual is horrible
1451892460	do deathmatch for practice with guns? casual for structure?
1451892496	gungame?
1451892512	gun game upgrades your gun every time you kill someone
1451892517	@Destiny when you push every round, youre extremely easy to counter..
1451892523	Leaf a like
1451892529	and whoever goes through all guns first wins
1451892538	that's cool
1451892547	honestly just try all the modes
1451892549	so you get to preview the guns
1451892552	some start with pistols and go to awp or whatever
1451892561	that's what it sounds like TBH
1451892564	others start at awp and go to knife hehe
1451892573	or nade
1451892591	Yeah, I also started playing CSGO recently. Definitely a hard game to learn
1451892592	think matchmaking order is pistols up to snipers and then knife?

1451893864	yeah id rather not
1451893870	do it you won't
1451893875	he read out something I said on twitch one time, apparently he can see it too
1451893882	is there something wrong with this crosshair?
1451893883	i had to bait him in to it though
1451893889	;/
1451893904	the problem is whne ur good, and ur lining up a shot, dynamic crosshari makes it impossible to line up an angle
1451893937	DarKcS not if you put a sharpie dot on the middle of your monitor Kappa
1451893947	u can make ur xhair a dot, Cammyo..
1451893949	the scouts only strat PogChamp
1451893950	so best thing is to do what then?
1451893959	DarKcS why would you do that when they have sharpies?
1451893964	forsenC forsenBoys forsenC
1451893964	without the lines on a crosshari, a dot makes it hard to judge vertically, so i stopped using it
1451894027	DarKcS there's lines everywhere though
1451894031	CALL RECKFUL HES CRYING

1451931124	@Allyofjustice It's because he has a lot of followers I bet
1451931126	Cool thing about Long War- it is literally impossible for him to finish this campaign before XCOM 2 comes out.
1451931128	he coulda actually bombed them
1451931129	You mean the telegram wires?
1451931137	Like the Internet studf
1451931138	Destiny I'm fucking disappointed, I'm so fucking disappointed in you. If you're gonna make a bomb threat can you pls go through with it. Don't just say things and then not do them.
1451931141	bomb em with memes
1451931154	why was his twitter suspended?
1451931162	@Robomullet yeah I think so too. If you don't have more than a couple of thousands followers you will probably get permanent banned for something like that
1451931163	True dat k1ash3r
1451931167	hi allyofjustice
1451931172	i rememberu from chat!

1451931419	Destiny gg
1451931423	AllyofJustice okay so basically Destiny got the impression that I was the leader of some sort of cult that kept downvoting everything he said and shitposting him
1451931434	This is the real chat. Destiny.gg chat is for memesters who want to feel special. OpieOP
1451931437	but that was a half truthm a lot of times it was random people shitting on him and i just joined in

1451933823	don't clump up your people, the aliens love throwing grenades
1451933825	the aliens keep getting stronger because of long war's new alien resource system

1451933922	try upgrading your gpu drivers
1451933928	wouldn't it be cpu/gpu since he has no buffering at all on laptop, so wouldn't be connection problem?
1451933936	laptop has the integrated chip and its smooth there. desktop has a gpu from last year

1451934438	xcom apocalypse has no flaws
1451934461	why doesn't he use the rocket launcher on the support class?

1451938611	His ISP
1451938612	cux = cox + cuck
1451938621	nickname for cox communications, his isp that cucks him
1451938625	destiny was just 3 edgy 5 twitter

1451938908	doesnt know who deezer is DansGame
1451938909	why is destiny so angry? agile is just a troll
1451938909	why are there so many map hackers?
1451938916	Just being stubborn cause hes mad
1451938920	just google deezer youll see
1451938921	It's easy and almost risk free
1451938924	Because people like winning
1451938926	@Naltron, Because it's Starcraft.
1451938949	when is the last time blizzard banned a high profile map hacker? probably never

1451938971	SC2 is a dead game ofc theyre not gonna waste time banning some map hacker
1451938978	deezer is a toss player though
1451938986	hey zerg players in here. i just started with lotv. 12 drones lol. my openers are all broken. will 17/17/17 safe against T and P ?

1451938989	deezer switched to league
1451938992	So I mean
1451938993	almost got in the lcs too lol
1451938997	Blizz are shit at banning
1451939002	Yeh but they still do ban waves on bots and improve bot detection
1451939010	Same with HS
1451939014	Blizz actually did a pretty huge bot ban a couple weeks ago for WoW
1451939020	Yeah Wow is a cash cow so they're better at protecting it
1451939031	FeelsBadMan
1451939034	And 99% of those people promptly went out and bought new accounts just like blizzard wants
1451939036	No shit, blizzard are a company they want to make money
1451939040	I did bot for two and a half years without any issues though

1451939078	@IAmThe_End, Yup, but only 50 people still play SC2
1451939080	loss
1451939081	@HeliumMuppet, Leave league and your MMR inflates
1451939084	diablo Kreygasm
1451939102	are there just 2 people playing or what, 3rd in a row
1451939117	i don't see the lag
1451939122	8ms LAGGING SO BAD
1451939133	this shittalk is low but with an edge
1451939134	destiny press ctrl + alt + f to see your ingame latency
1451939145	why is destiny fighting all the time. cant he be happy :)
1451939148	HuK would still complain about 8ms, its the only thing he can do instead of admitting he is shit now
1451939149	knife I tell you
1451939150	I love allchat Kreygasm
1451939151	CTRL ALT F = sc2 latency
1451939161	I like the new serene steven, it relaxes me!
1451939164	Naltron sc2 is a fighting game
1451939165	Naltron, he feeds of of negative vibes
1451939180	He cant win by being peaceful
1451939180	his lagging
1451939182	Sign of a mediocre player, complains about things being out of control at every opportunity, see it with NA players blaming scripts all the time on LoL
1451939201	@Fubick not true. look at neuro :) he hugs ppl win or lose
1451939209	im scared of neuro tbh
1451939218	neuro does get annoyed at times
1451939220	@Eddfir Lol. Who blames scripts?
1451939229	@naltron did you see that video on YT where he fights his alter ego with a keyboard in a forest lmao
1451939238	@Eddfir I mean, if you're playing against a script it's pretty awful.
1451939241	@Hydralinsk no haha where can i find it
1451939246	@Milo109, Bjerg, DL at least, I don't watch NA pros much, too much shitty rap and poor play
1451939254	@Eddfir But I dont think I've ever seen one in a game ive played
1451939256	@Hydralinsk im guessing everyone on that pro gaming house hes at locks their doors to sleep xD
1451939261	i like the guy. but hes scary
1451939276	@Robomullet, Yeh but they literally blame scripts in 1/5 games, 0 chance that proportion of high end players use those
1451939278	@Naltron https://youtu.be/OxOwub95BQ8?t=396
1451939281	NA pros are the worst LoL streamers imo
1451939298	It's super obvious when there is a scripter
1451939301	@Eddfir Who are you referring to? I don't know many pros who do that tbh
1451939308	its fucking crazy how people watch league streamers
1451939313	i dont play this game. but a friend told me that if i know how to play League of Legends this game will be easy to learn
1451939321	They have such a bad attitude, good players always blame themselves when things go wrong because thats the attitude you need to compete
1451939324	someone like dyrus was getting like 30k viewers like what the fuck
1451939325	@Naltron your friend is an idiot
1451939327	and nightblue
1451939334	the most uncharismatic and boring people
1451939336	Naltron, yes spend the money 100% worth it all the expo to
1451939337	@Helloimpulse I'd agree
1451939341	yet they get insane amount of viewers
1451939342	It's because of memes dude
1451939345	@Robomullet, DL = Doublelift, Bjerg = Bjergsen
1451939348	memes are the future
1451939353	gold league = gm sc2 ive been told
1451939365	poor troll
1451939367	that's fucking hilarious.
1451939370	terrible at it
1451939371	you're not even funny
1451939373	league of legends streams in general are really unenjoyable
1451939380	come up with some new shit
1451939381	ders.link/m8hah xD
1451939384	i fucking hated when destiny played league it was unwatchable
1451939387	atleast try to be a little funny when you're trolling @Naltron
1451939388	@Kamakasa Do you like League of Legends?
1451939390	not a fucking retard
1451939398	@Kamakasa, some streamers are good, but a lot just shove in shit music and endless donation cock sucking
1451939398	@Eddfir If you're arguing the Bjergson can't compete, than you're taking the wrong tack
1451939404	hey is dayz good ?
1451939411	no
1451939418	did they added cars yet?
1451939422	@Milo109, He competes fine in NA, not at a world scale. And I was talking in general, Bjerg is a decent midlaner

1451939484	league of legends is a good game, as long as you don't play or watch it
1451939498	lol
1451939501	League has been improving in quality consistently, the developers are solid, you probably just got bored if you think its gotten worse gameplay wise
1451939505	inb4 destiny bm's agile if he wins

1451939565	If you have a basic understanding of the game design it has now compared to 1-2 years ago then it has improved massively, if you honestly think jugs are OP you dont know how to play the game even half well
1451939569	being bm is pretty funny

1451940889	his channel is so awful it's almost unbelievable. apparently he's a serious nickleback stan? how is that even fucking possible?
1451940889	yeah so troll gms are making new accounts, throwing their placement matches to get to low mmr, then leaving league
1451940899	then they fight gms, end up beating a few and steal huge amounts of points

1451943540	it wasnt original i mean*
1451943543	Tool is the hsit

1451943616	what is tool
1451943618	they started as a mock band not sure what you expect
1451943620	10.000 days sucked
1451943624	an enema should be a part of everyones daily hygiene routine
1451943628	being a teen in the 90s, Tool was a great change from grunge. plus the live shows where worth it
1451943630	tool is for tools EleGiggle

1451943762	I think he told HBO the story so he wouldn't have to put any effort into writing the books
1451943764	@Traiborn I like SOAD's drummer a lot dont get me wrong, he is not a bad player he has excellent talent, i just think tool's percussionist was better
1451943768	books and show are both Kreygasm but books are more Kreygasm

1451944209	@Dcmccoy Opposite actually, darker skinned people produce more sea balm, their skin naturally moistens due to more skin pigmentation (melanin)
1451944212	@Prokeyboard yea some people like that but i had to think of an act more comparable to being into black chicks
1451944213	i think they are mediocre at best

1451945641	This guy dont talk while playing ??
1451945644	lateralus best album
1451945648	^
1451945649	Tool is best Live <3 Kreygasm
1451945650	10.000 days is great. Just wait for Rosetta Stoned and Right in Two
1451945651	Alexslayer30 you say that sacestecly but when i look at lol counter they are accualy very good vs muta
1451945655	since when did metal/rock have any interesting musical sounds at all? its just for angry prepubescents that want to piss off their parents
1451945656	21DaHoagie12, exactly
1451945663	weooooooowewwooeoeoeoeow
1451945667	@ImMakingToast, those are like only two distinguishable songs on this album
1451945670	make banes, run in, gg
1451945683	a guitar solo? wtf
1451945688	that interlude is actually not that bad
1451945690	Porcupine Tree though Kreygasm
1451945694	Wings for Marie?
1451945695	but the rest of the song is garbo garbo
1451945696	Destiny would make a good beta cuck IMO
1451945710	destiny is arguing with some imagined entity, while i think most Tool fans would agree that the entirety of 10k days is very similar
1451945711	that muta poke is massive
1451945714	Suhama you have to be trolling...
1451945719	Tool is music for Freaks like me B)

1451945734	SAYNsh, these guys actually have fans?
1451945734	That's because you didn't pick the best album: Undertow
1451945738	morgasm92, nope, he made his decision before this
1451945739	last time i heard anything off this album was when i was in line with my friends to go see primus,one of the radio stations had this playing on the speakers outside

1451946654	Reported. for playing horrible music
1451946656	change music
1451946658	how did he cheat?
1451946658	most guys here complaining about the music probably listen to generic music. So yeah..
1451946659	Rizcantonai there is a bug in the ladder system where you can leave your league and apparently get placed higher. I'm not exactly sure how it worsk but people are apparently abusing the system
1451946660	Leaving leave gives you GrandMaster MMR, that means destiny loses 20points and that guy gives him 1 point if destiny wins
1451946664	this song is taking 10,000 days to fucking end lol

1451946714	Airen13 thanks you very much for your answern:)

1451946743	lol
1451946745	why is destiny being such a depressing shitter today?
1451946752	exploiting is not blizz fault
1451946755	because if blizz hadn't supplied the bug, he couldn't have used it
1451946759	H
1451946759	@rociererer isnt that every day? Kappa
1451946762	What exploit?
1451946765	WELL MEMED SIR EleGiggle
1451946766	don't blame the user blame the dealer
1451946771	@Cobothegreat does it benefit their mmr or simply just the point system
1451946771	unintentional use of game mechanics is exploiting
1451946774	DcMcCoy, its literally impossible to discuss music objectively, short of saying things like "in this song they used X instrument". when the discussion boils down to things that bands have done before other bands objectivity disappears because there is always a chance that theres some that will like the later bands take on it.
1451946777	Rociererer when has he ever been positive or upbeat...

1451946863	why do people like tool
1451946867	like worship it
1451946870	DcMcCoy, if thats your whole argument then you just come off as a stereotypical elitist hipster
1451946872	porcupine tree has very similar songs aswell
1451946885	Lol, music may be subjective, but musical performance does have objective criteria. There are objectively bad and objectively good musicians out there.
1451946885	because they have simple minds, @SosooMad they are easy to please;\\
1451946886	they worship tool because theyve never heard real music
1451946889	these songs blend together more than Nickleback
1451946889	SosooMad, Tool are like anal fisting. love it or hate it kind of thing
1451946889	beethoven sucks aswell. actually mozart sucks dick. all music is meh. everything sucks beethoven sucks aswell. actually mozart sucks dick. all music is meh. everything sucks

1451946902	Toastmaster7727, whats real music to you
1451946903	pretty nice hold
1451946906	SAYNsh, it actually is much easier than you make it out to be, its not about bands who take inspiration from a certain style, look at how many people covered the ultimate "generic rock" invented by bon jovi, there is so much good songs, but complete disregarding the option to objectively judge art like music, is simply wrong, thats why we have academia on those fields, there is objective comparisons to be made

1451947172	Hard to like Tool much after you've listened to the best work of Dream Theater and Pain of Salvation, among others from other genre
1451947177	this guy picked the worst albim

1451947209	this music is kinda lame sounding tbh fam :/
1451947210	I like Tool, but I agree their stuff mostly sounds the same. I can only listen to it here and there.
1451947211	Tools live performances over there years are second to none
1451947211	Hotquacamole, not comparing them. it's just a lot more variety and different melodies/ structres

1451947366	SAYNsh, you are right, art is more subjective than objective, not saying these songs are awful trash so if you enjoy that, go ahead, i know i enjoy some generic shit aswell. also i am not an "intellectual". I'm merely pointing out that this music is in no way bringing much value, nor unique factors to the rock genre, tool is an alright band, i could listen to that occasionally, but objectively, they pale in comparison to truly great bands
1451947367	Saynsh shit music doesn't get published by a label, big or small. It may be subjectively bad once it comes off the recording studio, but that's due to the personal preference you are talking about. Objectively: the lyrics, instrumentation, mix, effects, mastering have all been made objectively good based on objective standards within respective fields.

1451947727	@Destiny progressive rock/metal is a very loose genre and tool is definitely progressive in some areas but not others
1451947729	@Destiny, Puscifer is where maynard started to change the sound up a lot Tool was a pretty basic sound because it worked for them
1451947730	So lets forget about the white boys and slap on some 50 cent
1451947734	system of a down: same genre, much more versatile

1451948596	MangoMosh, well he had a rich daddy who gave him, and i quote "a small 10 MILLION $ loan" but he ruined alot of family businesses in the construction business to enrich himself
1451948597	@Destiny How do you get the range indicators?
1451948598	nice bait @LittleFaces
1451948599	I feel trump being allowed to run at all is like a demonstration among the rules to once and for all settle the agrument that 'the eaters' will blindly follow whoever does the populist routine best, even if iets Mr. Phoney himself

1451948662	FunFact: Trump would have made more money if he invested in a famous new kind of drink, made out of squished mangos, called Mango Mosh

1451948799	DcMcCoy, putin is losing money as we speak and with no cash his country will not stand by him for much longer, plus he's like 70 years old with nobody to take over because everyone else in that government is either his puppet or dead

1451950574	What most people from north america fail to realize is that europe is in no way a unity in the same way that the united states are. Pretty much every country in europe speaks a different language, and far from every country in europe is part of the european union. And the european union is not one nation like the united states are. It's more like an economic alliance between countries that has a few shared laws that members of the union can freely choose to opt out of.

1451952317	Love how this is a video defaming an SC2 player on reddit is allowed here.On top of that there is no context that cloudm players (including, but not just this "jasonm") have been sniping my stream in an attempt to gain exposure for years now from HOTS -> LOTV.
1451952329	People here will circlejerk/hate all they want because that's all they can do, and people wonder why there's no good SC2 content when instead of throwing shit at the players in the community that stream the game everyday you could pay attention to the good content that promotes the gameplay of the game, not bullshit streamer drama and more reddit hate.
1451952336	@destiny Any better music yet?
1451952343	@Tingping1 WHOA BRO ZOZZLE
1451952347	I also don't deny that i've called this guy a hacker since HOTS because him and the other wastes of life in cloudm/imbaqq/etc consistently have stream sniped + stream cheated against me for the past 2 years.

1452023768	Jax_jaguars32, it didn't cut through because of the frequency and shit. You could see that the baton was getting overloaded during the fight for a second, though. If Finn were any good with a lightsaber he could have easily won. He was just blindly swinging it.

1452023957	thats JEdi training
1452023959	@Stealthsin That and the fact that she is literally a flawless character, oh never flew the millennium falcon before, doesnt matter super pro at that lol, never used the force before doesnt matter super pro at that lol
1452023961	>losing to protoss
1452023962	Spoilers............................the lightsaber part was all luck
1452023967	She has training, she has a mental block in her mind to forget she was trained in the past.
1452023970	rey actress Kreygasm
1452023974	and Kylo hasn't had a REAL competitor in ages
1452023974	Stealthsin, some theories exist that also say that Rey was already trained before, but lost her memory. Or that the lightsaber "gifted" her some memories of its previous owners that helped her out.
1452023975	Anyone? Why did GM ladder reset?
1452023976	SPOILERS--------------- she knew how to fight with her staff already. the bull shit was that she knew how to mind trick already
1452023978	remember when destiny had a twitter account EleGiggle
1452023982	Spoilers!!!!!!!....................English actors are hot Kreygasm
1452023984	@noxialedm apart from the fact Kylo just took a direct hit to the chest from the bowcaster that had been shown one shooting multiple people previously in the film
1452023991	SPOILERS --------------------------------------------------- Finn vs. Kylo is Black on Black Crime.
1452023998	thanks obama
1452024000	Jortalus i hope thats the case..
1452024003	Nuja_93, well, it was more like a direct hit to his gut/hip
1452024004	@NoxialEDM, SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------- ren was shot by chewie, that thing hurts. Also, Rey is like a rebellion fanatic or something, she knew a bunch of stuff about luke, han, etc, so she probably heard about things people can do with the force
1452024005	Luke's lightsaber is a horcrux, i mean a holocron
1452024016	SPOILERS_________ Im gay KappaPride
1452024019	destiny banned from twitter
1452024020	is this sc2 done quick? KappaAGDQ
1452024022	Nuja_93 haha fair enough I watched the movie a while ago and don't remember all the details
1452024030	LOL twitter......
1452024032	Stealthsin, plus, the Force just likes Rey AngelThump
1452024032	@jortalus either way it would have killed a normal man
1452024036	Stealthsin, it helped her out.
1452024071	luke skywalker in new star wars --------->https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Fh6eLXGmog/maxresdefault.jpg
1452024072	Also Leia look ugly as shit, they should have killed her off.
1452024074	fucking neural parasite...
1452024075	Nuja_93, oh no doubt. I think half the reason we saw Han blowing so many people away with the Bowcaster was to prove that it was more powerful than an average blaster. Then Ren takes a direct hit, gets right back up, and still manages to do hella stuff without "complete training"
1452024082	and the knowledge that kylo didnt want to kill her at the end probably helped
1452024087	Nuja_93, that said I think Kylo Ren is the best new character for sure.
1452024104	@Destiny, My gf just dumped me... I need your wisdom and advice. Happy 2016 everyone.
1452024104	kylo is emo xD
1452024109	He is the anakin we never got to see @Jortalus
1452024112	Neural Parasite Kreygasm
1452024120	wow such fighting
1452024120	@jortalus yeah, it's a good example of "showing not telling" or whatever
1452024123	protoss has some good units..
1452024125	kylo is so hot I love emo boys Kreygasm
1452024133	Yea kylo looks like a complete faggot, I hope they dont bring him back.
1452024135	I must be autistic, but I feel like with the way destiny played that fight he should of won.
1452024138	sup with the stream lag
1452024139	Why not just lurkers?
1452024153	he gg'ed PogChamp
1452024160	Pretty sure they chose him to play the part because he looks kinda weird
1452024160	zealots are pretty strong with speed mayne x.x
1452024162	What happened to GM LaddeR?
1452024162	kylo is beta and darth was alpha Kreygasm
1452024162	did they buff zealots?
1452024164	omg so dumb, chain fungals BUT still gives the zealots what they want to attack lings
1452024165	Who won
1452024173	Jortalus cant agree about Kylo Ren. He is angry whiny bitch and got beat up by a girl
1452024173	Wtf why is he not gm now?
1452024173	Flex
1452024175	@Standardpwnage, Don't bring him back? He's the second main villian that is going to revolve around the entire new trilogy lol
1452024176	why's he masters? different server?
1452024177	is destiny playing on EU?
1452024178	yeah they buffed zealot charge
1452024186	@uvsvdu, Every single gm was demoted
1452024188	PogChamp @Stealthsin
1452024200	@Curtsy really?
1452024200	oh damn, whys that curtsy?
1452024203	a whopping 4 people in GM
1452024204	^^^
1452024204	Yes really
1452024206	20 lurkers PogChamp
1452024206	Anyone know where is Nathanias today? I miss him :(
1452024206	han solo isnt dead hes coming back just like boba fett and darth maul
1452024210	@stealthsin yeah he's a flawed character, not a badass like Vader, that's kinda his character
1452024215	^
1452024219	They locked the ladder and then everyone was kicked when it was unlocked
1452024222	But if you wall with roacher to protect lurkers should be fine. And have hydra in the back for dps
1452024225	Stealthsin, The dark side is defined by anger and hatred, though. What's wrong with showing some of the symptoms of that in a relatively untrained example?
1452024241	Guys you don't have to sit through countless of hours of boring ass SC2 games anymore. Someone uploads all the interesting debates and talks from Destiny on this Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjMtzuEYwPE7Y88upYLyUcw
1452024243	GM was accidentally reset as when everyone got their bonus' pools from the league lock bug that happened for the past week. it treated everyone as if they had been inactive and removed from GM.
1452024245	@Nuja_93 he is way more than flawed. When he took the costume off there was nothing left.
1452024250	Kylo Ren is the Anakin Conflict we never saw cause EP 1 2 3 skipped him Jortalus Stealthsin
1452024254	I hate how every critic that has praised starwars would have destroyed any other movie if it had as weak of a plot and character development, but gives starwars a pass because its starwars. seriously it was a pretty shit movie.
1452024256	Im watching this stream for more then 1 day!
1452024263	i thought zealot charge worked like that in hots?
1452024269	no
1452024271	no
1452024271	Stealthsin, we never got to see what it was like for Anakin to transition from the Light to the Dark by relying more on unleashing his emotions. He was just suddenly evil. Kylo Ren is a good study in what sort of person turns to the dark side. Agreed, Angry_Midget_
1452024273	@Standardpwnage a friend of mine thinks the same way
1452024274	I wish XD
1452024282	no zealots do half damage on charge
1452024285	@Standardpwnage she thinks it was garbage
1452024289	@stealthsin eh, if you think so. I think he's still an interesting character with lots to prove and room to grow in the next two films

1452024323	No the silver storm trooper made no sense
1452024325	i wonder if luke will reveal to kylo that he brought vader to the light at the end
1452024328	Kamakasa, can you give an example of how he made no sense?
1452024329	Lol it was so funny. My brother is GM and he woke up and wanted to play 1 game. And he like" wtf my GM!!!" #thestruggle Lol
1452024331	He made sense
1452024335	Silver Stormtrooper PogChamp
1452024335	I liked the movie quite a bit, but I really disliked the cast
1452024338	just the power difference stuff
1452024339	I just cant understand how could he lose to that bitch girl
1452024342	But still came out lame
1452024346	at the start he stops a blaster shot
1452024348	brienne in my star wars Kreygasm
1452024351	then hes like super weak later on
1452024353	why do these pros know so little about the game they spend every hour playing

1452024363	cant fight the rea rei chick or the black guy
1452024364	@Kamakasa Exactly!
1452024365	That bitch girl is a Skywalker
1452024368	you expect him to be ultra bad ass, but... inside he is just a child that thinks he knows what is good for himself, and he choose the dark side. great character love him

1452024403	Kamakasa, let's be serious--SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER ((((Kylo Ren had just killed his father in a very emotional moment. He was conflicted. In that moment, Chewbacca shot him with the fucking BOWCASTER, which crippled him for the upcoming fight, but he still did pretty well.))) SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER
1452024404	He got shot by chewies blaster, which they spent 50% of the film reminding you how strong it was. He was not 100% when fighting rey
1452024409	Phasma had like two scenes, what was the point
1452024424	kylo ren got beat by a noob
1452024426	lol yeah ive heard that bs argument
1452024431	why are there so many messages on his screen that I dont see? Is he in another chat channel?
1452024439	Truth it gave Ray the chance to show her skills. Her noob skills lmao Jortalus
1452024442	Kamakasa, BS? Do you know what emotions are? Do you know what pain is? Are you even human?
1452024446	^
1452024447	Kamakasa those arent canon
1452024447	he has trained since he was a kid and the chick had never used a light saber
1452024452	LUL
1452024454	Alright, let me lay down some star wars lore for all of you, I have to start with 4-6 and the galactic empire
1452024456	i'll be ecstatic once they recast Fin and Rey
1452024463	nah kylo is great because he is the first dark side chracter that is unsure of himself, and the first time it's shown on the big screens
1452024464	gg
1452024466	this dude has donated like 30 dollars now
1452024470	rekt
1452024471	Kylo Ren got Cheesed
1452024471	@Curtsy Kylo ren aside. The bowcaster "sidestory" was so cringy..them reminding about it every 20 mins
1452024471	immemediately LUL
1452024476	@Kamakasa, She is trained, did you even see the movie? Read between the lines fag
1452024483	@Jortalus, you forget that sith draw power from pain you cuck
1452024488	@Curtsy She wasnt trained was she?
1452024488	Like had 1 week training from yoda and turned into a Jedi knight hahah
1452024488	What's the difference between this chat and destiny .gg???
1452024489	So the entire reason for the empires existence was actually to keep a defense force capable of repelling the star wars equivalent of humanoid tyrannids immune to the force at bay from invading their galaxy
1452024492	han/leia was 100% cringe all around
1452024496	^
1452024498	@stealthsin that scene with Kylo is literally the only reason they kept doing that though
1452024502	Remember how in the 4-6 movies that they never did justify why the empire was evil
1452024505	CUX SwiftRage
1452024507	That was supposed to be a twist for later
1452024509	it was never evil
1452024510	ImalsoAcai, emotional pain, though. Not fucking bloody gapes in their flesh lol
1452024511	Rey could have been trained when she was really young, which would prove why she was left in jaku when she was young
1452024514	@rallyhearts destiny.gg has more memers and combos
1452024520	because all jedi were being persecuaded
1452024520	@Rallyhearts one has autism the other doesnt
1452024523	Destiny.gg is empowered by memes and donations. Here we pretend we are better and there they do the same. So there is none
1452024530	han solo traiined her to be a jedi? wows
1452024530	Wait was Ray trained before they assaulted the "Death Star" Kappa ?
1452024533	Rey was trained when younger, Luke trained a bunch of jedi and Kylo went ape shit crazy and killed them all, Rey was mind wiped to protect her.
1452024536	Kriell, that's called a Retcon.
1452024544	Nah bruh its canon
1452024546	@profmcdougal she was born way after that

1452024548	split lings between high ground and low ground?
1452024548	She was left on Jaku because her parents knew she was a shit character and was hoping starwars wouldnt find her there
1452024549	Curtsy, that can't be confirmed
1452024549	Kriell, it's really not.
1452024552	they just ignored the books to make culture diversity star wars

1452024617	calm down hipster it was a VERY goosd movie

1452024839	Kriell, It shouldn't have killed him to begin with. The whole circumstance was so fucking arbitrary. It's like the author is all "I wanna kill Chewbacca but he's too smart to die in any normal way, so let's come up with all this gravity well bullshit, give the heroes plenty of warning, then come up with something retarded for Chewie to get caught up in and die somehow."

1452025106	@watermellion ayyy probably, not sure what the big threat is going to be though with no star killer anymore. Unless that theory that smoke is creating a clone army of force users from Luke's hand is true, that could be cool.

1452025144	well since it matches both old trilogies so well, i would expect episode 8 to feature a massive ground battle, and episode 9 to feature another star killer with a giant space battle that involves more than just x-wings

1452025379	who would win a fight between kylo ren and zeratul? Kreygasm
1452025382	It wasn't coruscant it was some other republic planets
1452025382	LittleFaces, to be fair, the movie's execution of the weakness is the same but it's actually a different weakness. The station was ONLY vulnerable while it was preparing to fire. The energy it stole from the sun needed to be contained and regulated by the structure that was destroyed. If it had been destroyed at any other time, it wouldn't have mattered. The planet collapsed because of the energy going wild. That's why rather than 'explode' it just formed into a ball of energy like a new sun.
1452025382	lol wtf
1452025383	gg destiny, with more training you will be able to beat player of this caliber

1452027193	The toss should just build a nexus in destinys base and recall to that
1452027194	^yes according to chat
1452027216	Toss is worse then Zerg on the op scale
1452027218	Lol
1452027231	Their early game is insane and late game is even worse
1452027242	When is the next episode of Unfiltered?

1452030634	@kappakingprime P.S I call SFxT coma fighter. Coma fighter is literally lot worse than sleep fighter with so many left over shitty ass mechanics from SF4 aka sleep fighter but made even worse because of shittier throw mechanics, and because they added another defensive mechanic aka roll tech to slow defensive piece of shit pace of the game even more.

1452031742	this version of darude is awesome
1452031743	Ive been playing cs for about 11 years now and have payed attention closely to the competitive scene i think the bans are for sure a good punishment showing that esports should be taken seriously even by the players
1452031746	MLG?
1452031751	@Mrell i think it just needs more time to grow, dota2 will always have a place for the moba try-hards but i can definitely see hots taking LoL's place if riot doesn't do anything to change the direction they're going in
1452031759	the LMNOP is such a shady org
1452031761	TBF, it's not Valve's fault but banning pros who compete in Valve sponsored leagues from using gambling sites related to CS:GO wouldn't be a bad move would it

1452034795	Lol
1452034797	Couldn't it be said that Destiny's neutral/defensive zerg playstyle lost the game? If you force Desrow to recall doesn't that mean you have the advantage and should be offensive?

1452034829	@HyRuul the other races take damage when they retreat. in real life retreating means you take more losses.
1452034830	and Destiny didnt have enough broodlords

1452034878	he was on 200/200 for 15 minutes and did nothing. so he hadnt to cry about recall
1452034893	is he still playing the zvp game?
1452034894	what
1452034904	its because the protoss had recall that he couldnt do anything
1452034910	Its prolly Thorzain
1452034913	punish etc..
1452034914	Protoss is the technologic advanced race, so forcefield and recal make perfect sense
1452034917	8unknownplayer2, NICE TRY DESROW
1452034921	this isnt real life and its a mechanic thats been in the game for ever. other people play around. its pretty autist to lose your shit if you know theyre gonna recall

1452034926	FRUITDEALER oh wait
1452034927	But guys Protoss always had recall

1452034956	i meant, its prolly thorzain the one comning back, someone asked. But its just my guess
1452034958	why are memes so meme now? what happened? affecting multiple games
1452034960	Every match most important item
1452034961	protoss just op just take all their units out of the game so they only got zealots left then its fair game
1452034967	@HyRuul you're ignoring the point dude are you even paying attention? it's a shitty ability for a *strategy game* because it takes the strategy out of army movement.
1452034967	what does that circle do?
1452034970	oh man american voices for Asura's Wrath are SO KappaPride

1452035035	probably both
1452035038	the strategy is moving your army when you have recall. you both have to play around it. its a pretty basic concept

1452035194	hmm juicy splits
1452035196	oh man dem splits
1452035202	rugglies, except that protoss army costs more than the entire zerg infrastructure in an average game so losing the game to being caught out ONCE by a race with free scouting (creep, overlords) is a 2/10 meme
1452035202	yeah beaverkat
1452035205	Ok i just come from Rotti stream and hes not sure its Thorzain that doing a comeback but Vortix O.o
1452035208	yeah man you definitely sound stable
1452035212	gg
1452035212	@rugglies I mean the Protoss always had recall but I think the real problem is how easy it is to use it
1452035215	What is dis? WoL? :P none of my games goes like that
1452035215	oh man twitch is so great

1452035226	this terran is bad
1452035227	ive been watching destiny play this game for years and i still have never played it or have any idea what is happening
1452035239	@KappaKingPrime true but protoss also trades hugely more efficiently than zerg. i don't think that's a complete argument.
1452035239	Destiny gonna get his twitter back or is he permacucked?

1452035270	@Randocchi a few things i guess
1452035274	this music is sick

1452035482	Star wars was awesome
1452035483	its terrible
1452035488	@KappaKingPrime i think you're ignoring how good shields are, the fact that a lot protoss lategame units are comparably mobile ( keep in mind we mentioned BL)
1452035489	rugglies, consider you have queens from the earlygame with energy built up, can easily make more with just minerals quickly and they're pretty competent at aa

1452035494	destiny can you play the "not a new nigga, I knew I had it in me all along, ayyyyy" song?
1452035499	@rugglies personally I think orbiters should come back and make it a early air unit where you have to research for both clock and recall and remove the mothership
1452035500	Destiny what did you think of Mad Max?
1452035502	you went to watch a Hollywood movie, there's only one person to blame for your wasted time
1452035505	Star Wars was OK, it was a fun ride, but it wasn't much more than a soft reboot
1452035506	@rugglies what's ur option?
1452035506	aka Savin Private Damon
1452035507	@KappaKingPrime, and i dont think youve shown that any Z advantage is worth the massive boon that is recall
1452035508	deadpool?
1452035519	did they introduce token black and gay character in SW?
1452035523	diversity
1452035523	@Destiny The Revenant was okay. I would watch Hateful 8 first shit was good imo
1452035530	Someone told me hateful eight was very good!
1452035531	token black check
1452035533	@mar45690 uhh thatd be cool but i think its bad to take too much from BW
1452035535	tarantino makes cool movies yeah
1452035536	i think the actor of han solos son is not very well picked and the fight at the end was really female like :D
1452035547	well yeh
1452035547	he has an eye for that
1452035554	great music
1452035555	@rugglies yeah but better then the current MSC situation
1452035557	that butter face of his
1452035558	Tarantino might be most genuinely fucking nutso fuck in movies
1452035560	he must be female
1452035561	rugglies, of course they're good, I do think the very lategame favors protoss when you get to build your dream meme army. Z gets to their endgame MUCH quicker though, while often able to pressure the P over the course of the game
1452035563	I guess that might be a good thing
1452035575	@mar45690 oh shit if they took out MSC fucking take anything from BW and im cool with it
1452035578	i liked the fights in star wars they weren't retarded like the prequels, just basic duels
1452035580	star wars wasnt bad, but for me they missed so much information about what happened since the last part...
1452035581	SuppysMom thats just how it is, when terran starts the parade push you have to use all your money to win decisively, no money to invest in long term advantage aka pit + pathogen + infestor. Move towards festors or hive slowly
1452035583	that how i meant it... idiot

1452035605	cuckatino is over rated as fuck, his moobies are ok, some are good, but the circlejerk for his moobies are retarded
1452035611	@KappaKingPrime so P army wins, but Z gets to some arbitrary benchmark a little faster, thus recall is perfectly fine? i dont think this argument is solid
1452035612	really ?! Tarantino ? out of all the nut jobs this world has wombed you draw the line a Tarantino ?!?!
1452035622	needs more banes

1452036170	or was
1452036172	ah
1452036178	@lowreezy they locked the ladder by accident (meaning people couldn't advance ranks or rack up bonus pool)
1452036180	GG lol
1452036183	gg
1452036184	but isn't destiny like top 100 and not in jeopardy of losing GM?

1452036897	9/11
1452036908	9/11 was the greatest thing that ever happened to usa
1452036909	no i just know how to go into engagements. and i just say, he could have defended.
1452036909	Flash retired what about it dark?
1452036928	well just look at the skill set he had
1452036931	7/11 was better but then the one near me closed so i guess it's a wash
1452036942	he retired because of lotv
1452036949	didn't want to transision
1452036960	lately flash has been far from the best in the world

1452037025	see what viewership is like
1452037038	Landazar88 definitely stronger, but still dying
1452037045	they're doing it all wrong, it should be in the contracts from the very start that anyone making money casting or playing their video game can be asked to stop without explanation at any moment
1452037056	kk, ive been out for a long time
1452037065	zvz is the reason i would never play zerg
1452037074	blizzard would make more money if they gave sc to NA or even EU compared to korea, as its easier to get the players through customs as opposes to the Koreans as they have to be not wanted by Kim Jon Shitstain
1452037077	that's in the user agreement elahwerif
1452037079	How can i set up the Kappa like Destiny's opponent
1452037083	zvz is the only balanced matchup

1452037408	he has little bar codes
1452037409	ban them all and let @Destiny sort them out
1452037412	pausing so he can throw that stream on the second
1452037413	so why are they going through so much hoops to screw this scene ?
1452037415	Deezo187
1452037416	must be a low grade player

1452040464	throughout my years in the star craft two game i've been in bronze to about high gm. Throughout the time many game styles came and went but there was one in particular that stayed i personally thought was worth keeping around. (IE WoL,Hots, LoV) that one style of game play is in fact mass overlords. Mass overlords is a very high level and challenging style to play because of the hard core micro and critical thinking involved in it

1452040657	with the massing overlords build the goal is pressure enough with the overlords to give you time to max out. some advantages you have going the mass overlord build is because they hover above the groud its very hard for lings to jump and attack them. same as zealots and so on and so on.
1452040663	who is rank #1 now on NA?
1452040664	Foobar2000 is the app

1452040887	@Waynejonbrady Ikr ?
1452040893	but back to the build. Since they cannon be attacked it eliminates all cheese early game and causes the other races to have to tec a lot faster puting you in an advantage. eventually you should be able to snowball with the overlord harass making it a quick and easy GG. but some builds do counter the mass over lords so you have to be very sneaky sometimes

1452041027	this protoss is so cancer
1452041029	this build is a very effective zvz build because most zergs go roaches. see roaches can only shoot their slime not to far so its very very hard for them to tilt their head up and shoot at the overlords. Most of the time they can only hit the overlords 30% of the time. But since your overlords do massive dmg they should be able to clean up the roaches without any problems.

1452041148	this toss is so good
1452041154	JOHN CENA 4Head
1452041156	So is toss the easiest race to play? I want to get started
1452041158	why 2 spires?
1452041161	banlings though are a very highly effective counter because since they can explode they can do a lot of dmg to the overlords bellys. see the over lords bellys are very unprotected. kinda likea hedgehog. but with proper micro you can easily out micro the banelings without loosing your army
1452041162	I always see ppl do that
1452041164	oh look he realized he couldnt fight that army CTRL Z
1452041168	!!song
1452041169	double upgrades
1452041170	you can really start with any race you like
1452041170	for upgrades while he gets greater spire
1452041173	ok but what or where is his separate chat lol
1452041175	Technically Zerg is the easiest race to play at low levels
1452041175	oo ok
1452041178	danBad instantcena.com
1452041178	or just double upgrades

1452042516	Guys im sure he knows whats going on him being rank 4 gm and us all being in wood league.
1452042523	that was op so they removed it back then but they've wanted to bring something like that back to reapers for a while
1452042531	it was kind of a rehash of new hope, but in all the comics and books the emperor just builds one super weapon after another so it's all a rehash
1452042543	interesting playlist
1452042545	I never messed around with it in campaign. you can't buy every upgrade anyway. especially if u want to beat Kerrigan at the end

1452042614	I also didn't like how they kept drawing out the scenes or beating a dead horse about how such an emo fgt the new darth vader is there when he goes emo and starts beating up his surroundings and don't forget they didn't use the reeeeeeeee sound effect when he was beating himself like a retard to make himself more angry/powerful

1452044157	@imTheMutt, its a black man
1452044161	I havent played sc2 in 2 years I used to play ruff on ladder all the time
1452044185	but now its a dead geam
1452044188	I've never gotten into SC2 but it's entertaining to watch it
1452044199	I play Starcraft
1452044200	...........
1452044205	But I am only in bronze
1452044208	uh-oh better hold those queens on the ramp
1452044208	its the hardest game to play competitively
1452044208	Kappa

1452044223	starcraft is so easy
1452044223	yeah its really hard
1452044224	people that say that sc2 is dead are the once that wish it to be
1452044229	guys im in bronze but i play like a gm mm suckssssss
1452044231	since they are to bad and cant face it
1452044234	test
1452044239	I got gm I wanted to play competitively
1452044239	Saying SC2 is harder than any other game is subjective
1452044244	@oregonkamm23 a dead game would be warhammer 40k dawn of war
1452044251	exactly
1452044255	but the jump from being in gm to competitive is a whole different level
1452044257	Ruff is acually pretty fun to watch, he doesnt go Bio normally.
1452044258	what program does destiny use for his music?
1452044259	Literally only 1000 people playing it

1452044340	What's SC2? This is an XCom stream Kappa
1452044343	it really isnt though

1452044381	diamond is shit yes
1452044382	I was grandmaster when I played
1452044384	Im GM
1452044385	why no gold, destiny dont know meta
1452044388	grandmaster is barely cracking the shell of what the highest level of sc2 gameplay is
1452044388	but then again wenn i look at the na servers i rarely see any good players in gm
1452044391	and grandmaster isnt even good compared to competitive
1452044394	i mean destiny is top 3 atm...
1452044394	i m diamond 2 in league of legend and play like a bronze at sc2
1452044396	were all gm but diamond is shit

1452044405	You don't have to be GM to put into perspective that Diamond, on scale, has nothing to do with the actual skillcap of SC2.
1452044406	Well, the game is dying
1452044411	When you pass Diamond, the actual game begins.
1452044411	Getting GM isn't that hard anyway

1452114584	destiny oh my god stop spoiling the movie and play long war
1452114590	There's this mini series called "And Then There Were None", Destiny, it's three episodes long and goes perfectly with what you said, with the Scooby Doo analogy.
1452114595	you drink the coffee and everybody is revieled
1452114600	tell me when he is done talking about htf8
1452114602	It's like, ten people on an island and one of them is killing the rest
1452114602	its closer to a western flick than a murder mystery

1452114853	OnASnowyDay, when
1452114859	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
1452114861	The movie is an anti trope as far as mystery movies go, it takes the "i would just do this" idea movie goers always have, and shows why it wouldn't work in this scenario
1452114861	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) /
1452114862	wait is this movie supposed to be like and then there were none OnASnowyDay ?

1452115843	@Rangerkaw his ban was only 12 hours which expired like 12 hours ago
1452115849	New xcom?
1452115857	MrHolySh1t, it expired days ago but he's still banned
1452115908	probably overall best bonus is france 40% this tierlist looks odd
1452115913	That's just one guy's opinion on what's an S-tier meme, though.
1452115928	That list is shit. The money you save with the Russian Satellites outweighs the reduction of the one time Officer Training School purchases
1452116012	isnt the best strat for this game satellite rush or something
1452116016	@pacjax so how has ur day been?
1452116021	idk i played on normal so it was easy
1452116023	@MesserSandman, not in long war
1452116031	mar45690, BrokeBack
1452116035	satellite rushing is bad in long war
1452116035	does that answer your question?
1452116041	Sure
1452116068	you see too many ufos for your interceptors to keep up
1452116069	How can anyone watch the same missions over and over
1452116074	France 40% bonus is the overall best bonus, if you want focus on psi, mexico 20% or Argentina +5 will are good.

1452119327	Now you can send private chat messages without leaving your current chat.Whisper to friends, followers, and subscribers to chat privately one-on-one across all of Twitch. Your whisper will show up in-line with the rest of chat on web and mobile apps no matter what channel you’re on. But only you and the user you’re whispering to will be able to see the conversation.
1452119328	@rociererer, just you
1452119330	dbozhilov, keep 'em coming mate
1452119335	dbozhilov, where are you bro
1452119336	@lakers656 nah they like the attention to much for that
1452119336	Simply type /w [username] into chat to send a whisper to any online user with the appropriate whisper settings. The username will autocomplete with the last 5 users you’ve whispered to or received a whisper from during that particular chat session, or you can type a complete username.

1452121849	then why would he give him the hinges? then he will just have a door that blocks his road tosuccess
1452121853	he says he opens the doors himself because they dont want you openning your doors to success and then you have to take the door off and take the hinges off and put the hinges in the fuckboys hhands so they cant close the door on you no more
1452121857	send the women to die

1452194707	@Destiny, would twitter ban your new account if you are banned on your main for "Ban evasion" or do they not really care if people make a new account when their original is suspended?

1452194789	the problem is that you assumed the transfer went through without confirmation and then you went on to buy the new ticket, they are not legally required to do shit, you kinda fucked urself

1452194896	@Destiny, Yes, some companies blacklist your card when you do a charge back simply because it's policy. Happened to me with a furniture company where I live.

1452195546	@Dcmccoy you just asked how israel is leading anything politically. UN keeps trying to anal fuck Israel, and they can't because the US - you german cocksuckers do everything possible to fuck Jews over
1452195559	And how are they now responsible for paying the 2 k ?
1452195565	So the 200 euro payment went through? Did you pay before 4PM?

1452195609	kamissick, UN doesnt try to fuck israel, as israel is the country that looks for peace the most, theyare supporting them bc israeli officials want the bloodshed to stop
1452195611	@Daytosis, They don't want to refund anything, they say every single thing is his fault.
1452195632	your mistake was using a middle man crook to book tickets

1452195670	@Destiny, so why aren't you charging back if you have proof that you paid for something and you didn't receive what you bought.? Is it too much of a hassle to deal with for $2,000?
1452195672	@Dcmccoy UN would have sanctioned Israel to hell and would have already created a palestine if it wasn't for the US. You european cockroaches are the guys who keep helping palestinians

1452200686	5 times a week
1452200692	No trainer would agree with that
1452200697	Destiny, its about the volume of the training, you can excercise every other day for 1h a day or every day for 30 minutes, etc
1452200708	Destiny if hilary and trump get the nomination why dont u vote for gary johnson ?
1452200726	Destiny, yes but that's why you rotate the muscle groups
1452200736	Destiny is that your excuse for not going to the gym?
1452200742	its a pretty bad one
1452200743	we all know vince mcmahon should run america or the guy who owns wendys

1452201170	i just cant get through the xcom base raid
1452201173	if a game requires anything other than keyboard and mouse its too autistic for me, darksouls falls under that category
1452201212	the steam controller is so comfy tho senpai
1452201213	darksouls came out same time as Dayz was popular for Arma 2 i chose dayz wisely i believe
1452201237	Day Z is shit
1452201252	so is darksouls.. apparently
1452201262	How does the steam controller compare to the ps4 controller that I use for some games?
1452201274	destiny should play kenshi, build a city, name all his fucks, get rekt by bandits

1452205893	i want to know why the big debate in public = /
1452205894	"friend" Kappa
1452205898	sodaG
1452205906	TriHard
1452205909	Warhound2733, because viewers and donations
1452205910	because twitch is getting money from leas subscriptions...
1452205912	she was already done with soda once, but came back for money
1452205918	MingLee
1452205919	As im pretty sure, the retards who watch soda, would follow him to any website he would stream at, and twitch doesnt want that
1452205921	-_-
1452205925	wasnt there the whole reynad thing
1452205932	She got 9k today
1452205935	from this whole thing
1452205937	she is 1-3k views
1452205939	between lea and reynad before she went back to soda
1452205942	shes like 3k+
1452205948	it depends on what she is wearing
1452205948	Yea but only today
1452205956	@Ashes2049 i would not like to gain views who feed off things like that just to bump numbers = /
1452205960	i'd watch him, hes funny, but i realized guy has over the top ego cause of his popularity
1452205961	destiny this is how mitch streams usually go, http://www.twitch.tv/reckful/v/33915453?t=04h47m40s the guys is an absolute tool
1452205972	slawFedorable
1452205972	I m a 1-4 person streamer
1452205974	Its about getting the whales that donate
1452205976	she around 3k ish, but with drama its like 10k, which is I guess why she loves it so much
1452205979	for those special messages
1452205983	FeelsBadMan
1452205985	Warhound2733, don't take this the wrong way but that's why you're not a 15k+ viewer streamer

1452208900	I've worked several jobs with both men and women, TheJRPGMF666, how about you? I've never even seen or heard of the slightest hint of hoodies being sexist, or that men can go to work looking unprofessional whilst women are somehow limited with what to wear to the point of not knowing how to dress themselves. That's what I have an issue with, now you can stop being such a massive fucking cunt and fuck off
