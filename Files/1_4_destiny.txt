1451865933 disorient wont work if the soldier is right beside
1451865934 destiny why are we playing this on impossible when you don't know how the game works x_x
1451865938 at that range i dont think flashbang matters
1451865959 this team is a fking travesty
1451865960 he has one shot anyway
1451865960 oh god this bravery

1451866041 wrong chat mike overrustle
1451866043 you can practically feel the emotional investment on these little snippets of voice-over . kappa
1451866050 @mikecom32 u are not welcome here overrustle
1451866052 can he turn off ironman
1451866058 so we can finish this game
1451866072 if he pass the panic test he can do whatever but acid lasts a while
1451866079 @cheezecake123 i'm on my phone because i'm watching on my chromecast
1451866079 ozar cucked the team feelsbadman
1451866089 ironman is essential for fun
1451866093 regular playthrough on this takes 200-300 hours
1451866102 ozar what a drama
1451866103 destiny you have no ending "
1451866105 long was is pretty long
1451866107 bronzeman would probably be better , but you don't really win impossible long war , you just try to survive as long as possible

1451867751 nathan is aliv thats all that matters
1451867754 scientist was good before he retired
1451867759 may the memes be with you
1451867760 is momo alive ?
1451867762 and allso wiith you .
1451867765 either quit or run to extraction failfish
1451867770 if theres another group you ; re fucked anyway
1451867773 he still has to kill the groups that come when you get closer to the extraction
1451867778 do you think if momo was alive we'd be in this mess ?
1451867794 even if there isnt another group there are doods that jump down when you get guy to extraction
1451867804 destiny is already fucked

1451867838 cant u just bind a key to restart
1451867850 no , that would be cheating
1451867856 yea maybe a glitch does that
1451867861 but he isn't going to
1451867873 he should have put at bronzeman in 2nd wave
1451867881 this mission is too stressful
1451867884 being able to restart would defeat the purpose of doing ironman difficulty in the first place
1451867886 right thru the dick
1451867910 this ah , doesn't look good for our intrepid heroes .
1451867926 and then there were two

1451868158 ozar just looked around and died
1451868179 he was pretty bad

1451868189 ozar was pretty good at bleeding out

1451868624 i love how when any little aspect of law makes something obligatory for americans , even though these laws are usually in place for the benefit of people , everybody starts complaining how their freedoms are being taken away .
1451868658 ' destroyed ' and ' slammed ' are words that , if on a video or article , cause me to not read or watch it .
1451868666 we value freedom over our well-being , no kidding mattv91

1451868940 @desert_doge , she wanted money lol she had attention already she was a streamer ..
1451868942 do you think she regrets it 100%
1451868943 so wait did she have cancer or not ?

1451868994 wow she'sa piece of shit
1451868994 she strikes me as a pathological liar , it is not as if she knows why she lies , she just does it out of compulsion , most likely for attention .
1451868995 wait cats can speak ?
1451868999 that face paint is really triggering me
1451869006 im surprised avilo doesn't take donations for his debilitating autism

1451869012 " smokin 420 blazin it "

1451869017 she had cancer , got 420 , now cancer free
1451869025 now she's saying that she never said she had cancer
1451869033 @destiny didnt know cats can speak
1451869046 @traiborn there we go , typical american reaction .
1451869046 this was in 2014 if i recall correctly
1451869047 @destiny , you're responding to a comment that was made years ago
1451869048 what a fast typer
1451869054 destiny with the reddit rampage pogchamp
1451869066 @destiny , and that guy was clearly angry because she lied about having cancer to get money and is still streaming on twitch
1451869068 he means free passes by twitch staff i thought
1451869078 @mattv91 go drink tap water you fucking pleb
1451869078 damn dat ragepost after reading half a sentence
1451869085 go back to the beginning
1451869093 people on twitch and reddt tend to do a witchhunt . i hate that
1451869095 is someone talking in the background ?
1451869097 livestreamfails is just a bunch of retards
1451869100 or can i not find this tab ?
1451869102 @destiny the cancer she named off doesn't even exist .
1451869103 literally the start of the video she says it herself
1451869104 why are people pissed at the chick ? doesn't seem like much basis other than maybe asking for donations
1451869107 haimilol just subscribed !
1451869110 this is just reddit in a nutshell
1451869114 getting told to kill yourself . the life of a streamer
1451869118 nathandubs1 nathandubs2 nathandubs2 nathandubs2 nathandubs2 nathandubs3
1451869118 destiny do you like that butt jiggle of dinglederps
1451869121 lying about cancer is a bitch move
1451869121 she could have just fucked up
1451869129 i just linked to that reddit thread in her chat and got permabanned
1451869129 she could have lymphoma or leukemia
1451869134 lol courtesy of autismpowers : i was on a flight and ordered a coke . the woman asked me " do you want the can sir ? "
1451869141 he got banned for it in her channgel
1451869147 golden_master2001 , link o.o
1451869152 @traiborn care to explain your point , or are you just gonna keep throwing shit like a 2 year-old ?
1451869171 a few months later , she was going through a rather off phase when streaming , and uploaded a youtube video saying she had leukemia . she said she didn't want to go through any sort of chemotherapy , and live the rest of her life however long it would be happy .
1451869173 maybe she was fine again at the point she mentioned it ? not sure
1451869176 gangbang her every day she must suffer
1451869179 url is this true ?
1451869213 destiny can we just agree that kneecoleslaw just didnt something a bit careless but the witch hunt against her , and the uncalled-for-banning is just retarded ? have you read the twitter autism ?
1451869234 gawntlet , do i want to read it ? >.>
1451869241 hi my name is emily and i am a 22 year old girl that one day dreams to be a cat . i hope to travel to the land of africa to join the legendary jungle cats of the wild in order to learn their ways . fucking cunt
1451869245 just tuned in , hows the xcom going ?
1451869285 @trattpingvin assuming he doesn't get massacred this mission it should be going well
1451869294 @gawntlet why is it uncalled for she strangled a cat
1451869301 @mattv91 blindly accepting laws is retarded . saying " if you have nothing to hide you shouldn't worry about everything you do being seen by the feds " is one of the shittiest arguments ive ever heard . you're absolutely mentally retarded if you think the gov't has your best interests in mind . i'd tell you to wake up but you're too busy living in a fairy tale
1451869308 thanks big guy kreygasm
1451869317 lol she didnt stangle a cat she held it agianst her
1451869317 @destiny , are you playing lotv today ?
1451869321 thanks big sky seemsgood
1451869323 what happened to the girl who strangled her cat ? is she already streaming again ?
1451869324 just a little because she was in pain ledengary , its nothing to get pitchforks for . especially shouldnt be banned
1451869329 @kamelasa prob after ice cream
1451869329 @ledengary , the cat was never not able to breathe at all
1451869332 where's pequad ? swiftrage
1451869333 people still baiting about the cat lul
1451869335 she just said " are they gay " referencing sky williams xd
1451869340 theres no reason to assume wanted to hurt
1451869345 thats what strangling is lol
1451869358 is this emote total biscuit ? lul
1451869363 kneecole ? didn't she have a really lewd video or something ?
1451869365 i dont like that streamer she seems like a drunk chick getting money for her boobs but c'mon at least be accurate
1451869370 they run just like roaches
1451869380 @konjk choke the shit out of her cat
1451869384 sectoids are so kawaii
1451869393 her and the cat just enjoyed s&m dont judge bionicbunion
1451869397 sectoids are technicaly stormtroopers they are both clones
1451869404 i am pretty sure she made a lewd video
1451869405 i wouldn't be surprised if the cat is now dead
1451869410 @mar45690 , thanks ! is there an eta on that ?
1451869410 is destiny actually defending her ?
1451869412 god people are disgusting .
1451869419 destiny white knighting again , what's new
1451869426 destiny is the cancer expert
1451869431 destiny a doctor !
1451869442 @traiborn dude , looking for drugs and drug users is a social security issue that every single fucking government is actively trying to keep up whether or not you think your liberty is more important or not .
1451869445 destiny's wife had cancer if i remember correctly . probably knows a bit .
1451869448 destiny has cancer guys we need to donate
1451869449 destiny is a literal sjw pogchamp
1451869461 don't be retarded ? thats brilliant pogchamp
1451869475 i can suck a dick
1451869491 wtf is goin on ?
1451869502 this chat is hhhehehe
1451869508 he's about to get wrecked
1451869509 putting dicks in my mouth lul
1451869517 is this the stream where they break up
1451869517 does anyone remember the guy who pretended to be paralysed ? and then he stood up on stream ? lol i think he still streams
1451869537 vyvanny yes that was hilarious
1451869545 shitgun bro is flanked
1451869552 ive never seen this game before and all i hear is sucking dick 100% worth watching
1451869557 zilianop was the streamer
1451869585 who is dusty listening/talking to ?
1451869586 @mattv91 it would be one thing if the tests were legit as to if someone was actually intoxicated or not . but it's stupid that someone could have smoked weed 2 weeks ago and will still trip a blood test . the thc in their system isnt going to do anything to impair them yet the blood test is still going to show that their under the influence . mandatory blood tests are litteral autism until they can perfect the method
1451869587 what a beast pogchamp
1451869599 lmfao when did @destiny become an sjw ? since he moved from sc2 to lol ?
1451869601 doesn't zil stream on hitbox now or something ?
1451869618 gimme some of them cux bux
1451869652 @traiborn every government is interested in keeping up national and social security ( or at least the image of it ) therefore they will keep doing things like these to maintain security .
1451869657 what a social justice warrior
1451869659 having lots of sex doesn't make someone a slut . having sex without caring about the other people makes you a slut .
1451869665 esoterikk , it'sa miracle pogchamp
1451869679 being easy makes you a slut
1451869694 iaxx is a monster
1451869698 @traiborn the authenticity of the tests is an entirely different thing .
1451869700 did he restart again ?
1451869703 nothing wrong with being easy as long as you're honest about it .
1451869707 can i play this game in koop mod or multiplayer at all ?
1451869712 destiny's chat best place for policy discussions kappa
1451869727 lowtiergod is fucking hilarious . he's the villain character that the fighting game community needs
1451869739 i know everything i know about politics from destiiny chat 4head
1451869740 the fgc needs more ' characters ' to build hype
1451869746 someone should make a camsite that's based around gaming
1451869772 @mattv91 defending the loss of your personal freedoms is a pretty slippery slope m8
1451869784 i would but i haf to download it first
1451869785 should there be an 18+ version of twitch
1451869787 @traiborn if the tests show that i've smoked weed when i was 14 and dumb , then i will be paying the price for a mistake i made .
1451869787 gawntlet , wheres the box i'm supposed to check indicating my superior understand 4head
1451869792 fchamp is good enough villain character , ltg is a legit dumbfuck
1451869799 understanding * rather 4head
1451869805 hitbox should do it
1451869811 their current shit won't work
1451869831 @traiborn it doesn't change the fact that it was illegal then , and it is illegal now .
1451869879 cause she needs attention
1451869879 it's called wanting attention
1451869893 press f to pay attention
1451869895 ignore her , she'sa fucking feminist
1451869907 it's like the giving the homless prank 4head

1451869924 agdq is going on
1451869927 female destiny would be a slut
1451869928 its not a selfless act out of concern as there is a underlying ulterior motive
1451869931 @mattv91 does money play any sort of role in your decision making ? you know how pharmaceutical companies are always spending money to help keep it illegal ? because it'sa healthier alternative and actually better for you ? you gotta think between the lines man .
1451869936 autism gaming done quietly
1451869958 i . e ..... i care but i don't really care , care . i just want some attention for me as well .

1451870004 strange they let him in this year
1451870006 @mattv91 the gov't is bought off and paid for . money goes too far in this world we live in
1451870023 sightbain , how can you type with all these cocks covering your face
1451870045 is that a real life grill ?
1451870053 no it'sa fake grill
1451870054 public attention whoring like that is stupid and the people giving them that attention are just as stupid
1451870063 @kappakingprime , only on my face not in my hands duh
1451870067 how can she be depressed with those titties ?
1451870085 @trolledtroll just a 12 year who hasn't gone through puberty yet keepo
1451870087 erin with the fkn burn
1451870088 who is talking about depression ?
1451870089 @traiborn are we careening over into conspiracy theories now ? i don't care if it's healthier than cold medicine , if it makes people act retarded and be considered a liability to social security , then i can't consider it safe .
1451870091 do they have it hard ?

1451874419 the hound is still alive
1451874423 did they even hire the actor who plays jon snow for this season ?
1451874438 he's on set .
1451874451 those are just for promotional photoshoots kappa
1451874453 books =/ = the series
1451874459 vader is the father
1451874460 he's going to die in the books , just later and in a different manner
1451874464 not only did they hire him he has been spotted on location multiple times
1451874476 how far ahead are the books compared to the show ?
1451874481 i'll bet 10 cucks
1451874488 the show is ahead of the books now
1451874493 they might somehow use thoros guy for it
1451874494 he wont be white walker , he'll be aziz anzari or whatever the dude is called kappa
1451874497 yep , show is ahead already

1451874515 if he doesnt get revived by fire bitch he will become white walker and badass
1451874520 a whole fucking pool of blood though .
1451874533 he only got stabbed like 80 times
1451874535 king robert died off screen
1451874535 nedstark didnt really die
1451874540 or burned or how ever they do it
1451874561 robert wasn'ta key character hhhehehe
1451874565 you cucks pogchamp lmao
1451874570 holy fuck robert is azor ahai
1451874570 fire lady can bring him back
1451874581 thoros can as well @geers_art
1451874585 fire god brought back someone who was chopped in half kappa
1451874587 steven have you seen " making a murderer " and " the jinx " ?
1451874589 stannis is still alive in the book ???
1451874596 how can you die off screen in a book ?
1451874597 firelady sucks are reviving . they'll use that other guy
1451874620 res ygritte while you're at it angelthump
1451874620 in the book he didnt even kill his daughter
1451874620 it's incredibly weird . they wouldn't miss out on the chance to show one of the most loved/hated character brutally die . got thrives on viewer tears
1451874620 thoros brought back dondarion like 4 times lmao !
1451874620 the guy that got practially cut in half ?
1451874623 that was nuts lol .
1451874641 @poshlydressedviking , they can cover it up like if people are on a ship , they won't say the captain died , but they can say the ship went up in flames
1451874655 but we all know the mountian survied
1451874657 so it can be assumed that the captain is dead , but it isn't specifically stated
1451874670 the mountain gonna be a zombie
1451874677 wtf he has no lab yet ? notlikethis
1451874692 i want to see the hound vs mountian
1451874697 gonna be a great fight
1451874710 @destiny you need a 2x3 block of workshop adjacency ( not just worksops ) bonuses to be able to afford later game weapons and gear , resources is the limiti for growth in lw and workshop rebate bonus is what saves you this ( and interceptors are your " drones " bringing in more resources )
1451874716 i hope more episodes leak
1451874732 alexslayer30 theres been a leak ?
1451874747 first 4 episodes were leaked before they were aired
1451874753 did destiny make the timer ?
1451874757 haha i remember watching 4 of them and then waiting a moonth
1451874762 isnt the hound dead in the series ? in the book he turned into a monk or something
1451874764 fk the leak , the 3 weeks wait sucked balls feelsbadman
1451874775 season 5 was worst season by far
1451874791 but the pretty dragon
1451874812 hardhome was good , rest was kinda boring
1451874814 reading book 4 residentsleeper
1451874818 s6 should be amazin
1451874818 we have to go deeper ....
1451874827 @destiny workshops become important when you start buying later tech gear , sitting there they do nothing , also one or 2 labs is ok if thats your thing , i personally do hard focus on planes to get more income , then ai tech for gauss weapons , and once i have fancy gear to buy i go hard for many workshops right when i plan to spend big and get the rebate just in time
1451874837 book 4 is the best one to reread , tho , so much stuff in there that's easy to miss
1451874841 lemmiiwinks i wanted to see him in some epic battle :(
1451874856 gawntlet , not the death he deserved feelsbadman
1451874862 slifeofham was book 4 the one where they went to that graveyard that hinted that the hound was still alive ?
1451874893 it's all because of skell never forget never forget biblethump
1451874897 but im pretty sure that's not really a thing ? it was just some dude who took his helmet
1451874898 tfw destiny gets better grades than you feelsbadman
1451874910 need to fulton the aliens
1451874910 slifeofham yea no joke theres a lot that i missed but i didnt re read , i just read a thread on r/asoiaf and read all the shit i missed elegiggle
1451874920 i like how he says " commander "
1451874940 @destiny aliens also gain " research points " at a rate of one per day , and a bonus amount for certain ufo missions that you do not mess with by shooting them down or assaulting when landed ( this happens even if you do not have a satelite to see it happen ) so interceptors both bring in resources and slow alien growth rate , i find them the strongest investment in lw
1451874940 just said it there lol
1451874946 it was on that screen
1451874960 i saw a spoiler about jon dying .. but then it didn't happen when i thought it would .. but then it did so it's allmost like it wasn't spoiled 4head
1451874960 @destiny it's at the top of the officer training school tab
1451874974 @slifeofham wasn't it like " the man you know as the hound no longer exist " or something but the dude is still alive
1451874989 is he using long war ?
1451875008 when will this guy play league again
1451875017 he got banned on league so never lul
1451875030 well he did flame alot

1451879772 to go masturbate lul
1451879777 probably to get high
1451879778 he treats as a job
1451879780 destiny he just sticks to a schedule because to him it's nothing more than a job really .
1451879784 cause he wants to and it's his life
1451879784 i just think its his schedule and nothing more
1451879785 to eat and spend time with his wife maybe idk
1451879786 maybe he just considers that his working hours or something
1451879786 i don't even know who lirik is
1451879788 cuz hes a ***
1451879790 because the $$$ already in his pocket fools lol

1451879819 destiny some people actually feed their kids #feednathan
1451879825 i watch him but he does .. its a job over hobby for him he just wants to put his hours in and go to netflix
1451879829 maybe his gf/wife forces him to get off , or he just wants the money . maybe both
1451879832 he has to make it to his chemo treatments for the cancer he has from reading that post
1451879834 oh yeah mr krabs

1451880325 that game looks so bad i just cant
1451880325 destiny trust me , if you play duskers instead of ftl the autism in chat with literally go jewclear
1451880331 ftl is autistic enough for destiny , it's hard with a high skill cap like a train schedule
1451880336 @destiny give us aslan
1451880343 godiikeguy , you're being redundant hhhehehe
1451880345 ftl is just so boring to watch though
1451880345 ftl is pretty kewl
1451880353 destiny if you're going to play autism games just go all the way and play dwarf fortress , it'd be a meme farm
1451880356 a little bit feelsgoodman
1451880364 dakuten its more about the ruleset and mechanics than the graphics

1451885246 i think u lost
1451885255 it sounds like " toe " a japanese mathrock band
1451885257 idk what song thoguh
1451885274 naw it's avilo he is tilted about zerg mina
1451885275 the song is in funny talk i cant read that
1451885334 does anyone actually like avilo ? he seems so immature and annoying
1451885342 @cute_sc2 i think z is also favoured in lategame generally , its what they gonna nerf but most people complaim about ravagers etc what is clearly not op
1451885363 lol its actually pretty balanced
1451885367 i just hate when destiny whines
1451885374 @destiny song name plox !
1451885385 especially when his race is most likely favored kappa kappa vs p atm
1451885386 destiny.gg - kanye west - good night
1451885398 zerg lategame is not op , its favoured . its a bis difference
1451885407 does anyone know what that last song was
1451885409 avilo viewbots doesnt he
1451885410 zerg is not overpowered lategame . yes , if you get there with an economy advantage , you have a huge lead - as it should be .
1451885424 viper bomb should probably be tweaked along with the infestor range thing
1451885427 but other than that yeah
1451885447 did he lose or win ?
1451885460 he got destroyed . those kind of losses are the best to learn from , thoughj .
1451885475 what a bullshit build though , hellbats wm drop into double lib
1451885481 like all the terran cancer into one build
1451885483 its definitely strong lol @xerevgaming ultras buffed to 8 armor ? broodlords buffed to 11 range ? infestiors buffed ? vipers given viper bomb ? and colossus nerfed
1451885490 does anyone know what that last kanye song was

1451885509 destiny , you have good taste in music i think – can you explain why you think kanye is good ? his voice always sounds bad to me ...
1451885512 now they suck xd
1451885520 kanye west is a god
1451885526 @cute_sc2 if you're talking about protoss , don't get me started , because their earlygame became so much stronger that getting to the lategame unscathed is a goddamn miracle .
1451885527 destiny.gg - maybeshewill - ...
1451885557 where does dustony find his musac
1451885569 @xerevgaming , well now your'e changing subjects . we were just talking about whose favored in the late game ..
1451885571 destiny composes all his music himself
1451885577 he missed his 3rd
1451885585 fuck you destiny bot , cuck fuck piece of shit
1451885593 @xerevgaming , and thats not true with queens at each base and roaches you dont take that much damage from adepts
1451885593 destiny.gg - maybeshewill - in amber
1451885596 @cute_sc2 they got rid of deathballs only to give protoss a unit that actually shoots deathballs topkek
1451885599 cute_sc2 you have to realise the " lategame " isn't an even state . if you come to the lategame with same bases as zerg as protoss , protoss is -easily- favored .
1451885600 im drunk af and need help
1451885616 when i say late game
1451885622 destiny.gg - maybeshewill - in amber
1451885641 how many beers is too many beers for sc2 ?
1451885653 7 beers is too many
1451885660 you mean a mmaxed zerg army with broodlord/infestor/corruptor/queen - something which protoss in the last game proved can be beaten with tempest , archon , immortal storm .
1451885665 ranked or unranked ?
1451885671 i'm saying if you have ultra , broodlord , infestor , viper with corruptor support in legacy your army can't die @xerevgaming .
1451885682 yes it can . it was proven last game .
1451885682 tldr : i've had 4 and im this close to have a 5th ; i dont feel tipsy biblethump
1451885682 and yeah if you have queens transfusing as well
1451885691 its nowhere near as onesided as you seem to believe .
1451885693 @xerevgaming , destiny didnt hav ethe right comp lol
1451885709 drinking beer to get drunk is a lost cause
1451885715 depends on time its taken to drink those beers
1451885719 oh good we're finally back to sc2
1451885719 @xerevgaming , if they go pute tempest you get ultras to push back the ht and spam corruptors and a coupel vipers
1451885724 @cute_sc2 destiny was on 6 bases and was gas starved . what more do you want .
1451885726 destiny.gg - maybeshewill - in amber
1451885728 cute_sc2 yeah if we can go to 300 supply , we can have all that lol
1451885739 no everyone on 200/200 can hav ethat
1451885746 your ignorance is baffling .
1451885748 with like 70 workers
1451885756 i'm gm my ignorance can't be that baffling
1451885757 but not 1 viper 1 inferstor you know
1451885761 can you guys quit complaing about dead game
1451885771 okay crazy question time , how much would the game change if their was no supply cap ? or say 600/600 supply cap
1451885773 he is fucking good
1451885781 go read his stream
1451885781 the game would lag
1451885787 it says " can't beat zerg "
1451885788 the game would lag
1451885789 only best system would be able to manuver
1451885793 hahaha yeah i know
1451885798 but he is top 1 , so must ea lie
1451885800 my pc would die
1451885803 and he just shrecked destiny . destiny losing doesn't have anything to do with the balance rofl
1451885806 why did he attack the medivac when the remaining enemy units were mech ?
1451885818 guess he was tilted
1451885822 whos in teh top 1 spot ?
1451885828 hellbats are " semi-mech " - bio stuff .
1451885832 it is not nice
1451885836 playing with that amount of lag would be annoying
1451885840 was really enjoying this chill stream too biblethump
1451885842 turned off their streams
1451885844 he played so bad lmafo
1451885846 this is why they need to nerf terran , to get destiny to stream longer biblethump
1451885847 what do we watch now
1451885854 oh yea they did lol
1451885860 i was watching neeb
1451885866 watch speedruns now for cringe

1451891374 meme standards have changed for all you kids now dansgame
1451891399 memes are mostly nowadays kappas or minglees , i know they are stupid but twitch chat thrives on it
1451891422 kappa is very old though
1451891428 it should have died by now
1451891439 the top meme nowadays is gachi , the world was a better place when kappa was on top

1451892014 dang csgo .... :/
1451892016 i'm tempted to try this game
1451892021 is it fun ?
1451892032 @thxmanny does it look fun
1451892060 so it's not fun ?
1451892065 game has great tournaments
1451892086 its fun . takes some practice not to be utter shit at it though
1451892098 @thxmanny if it wasnt fun ppl wouldnt play it
1451892101 i can do that
1451892116 the community is the same as league but with epeen skin waggling too .
1451892193 i'll give this game a shot then
1451892203 @destiny , fyi careful with the title , twtich admins are sensitive
1451892228 thanks for the input chat
1451892245 csgo is fun , get ready to mute people as you first start playing though
1451892256 why say that ?
1451892289 you need to reach ... level 3 .. i think before you can start playing competitive . atleast when i tried to play casual a few months ago there were a lot of mic spammers
1451892317 oh so i can't play this mode that destiny is playing right away ?
1451892321 he pushes every round notlikethis
1451892327 you can browse for community servers though , i find those better than the regular valve-hosted ones
1451892337 mrmoerphy , not on dust 2 !
1451892345 oh , my bad kappa
1451892354 mrmoerphy , long a with the awp is his specialty meme
1451892355 yeah this is competitive 5v5 , you need to learn the basics in a few other game modes first
1451892386 ok , so start with casual then ? do you recommend a different mode ?
1451892409 casual is basically the same as this but with more people
1451892413 deathmatch is the best for practice
1451892418 then there's deathmatch which is regular deathmatch
1451892428 with near instant respawns
1451892441 should do a combination of both
1451892445 play gungame , casual is horrible
1451892460 do deathmatch for practice with guns ? casual for structure ?
1451892512 gun game upgrades your gun every time you kill someone
1451892517 @destiny when you push every round , youre extremely easy to counter ..
1451892529 and whoever goes through all guns first wins
1451892547 honestly just try all the modes
1451892549 so you get to preview the guns
1451892552 some start with pistols and go to awp or whatever
1451892561 that's what it sounds like tbh
1451892564 others start at awp and go to knife hehe

1451893764 it isnt called mechanics
1451893768 its called game sense = =
1451893782 hes going to run out of bullets
1451893801 wish someone would teach snepai not to use dynamic xhair
1451893804 all part of your master plan ?
1451893806 that's the fucking awesome
1451893857 darkcs go to d.gg telling him to use a better crosshair and get banned
1451893864 yeah id rather not
1451893870 do it you won't
1451893875 he read out something i said on twitch one time , apparently he can see it too
1451893882 is there something wrong with this crosshair ?
1451893883 i had to bait him in to it though
1451893904 the problem is whne ur good , and ur lining up a shot , dynamic crosshari makes it impossible to line up an angle
1451893937 darkcs not if you put a sharpie dot on the middle of your monitor kappa
1451893947 u can make ur xhair a dot , cammyo ..
1451893949 the scouts only strat pogchamp
1451893950 so best thing is to do what then ?
1451893959 darkcs why would you do that when they have sharpies ?
1451893964 without the lines on a crosshari , a dot makes it hard to judge vertically , so i stopped using it
1451894027 darkcs there's lines everywhere though
1451894031 call reckful hes crying
1451894045 darkcs aiming headshot level with a dot isn't that hard failfish
1451894056 dicedlemming i saw the vod
1451894063 mom0momo , you were famous pogchamp
1451894063 i couldnt beliebe it myself
1451894103 yeah with practice im sure cammyo

1451894156 24 deaths wow so bad
1451894163 well its gold nova wat can i expect
1451894168 darkcs since your camera comes out of your head in cs all the walls on any map when vertical on your monitor means you're aiming headshot level
1451894200 did he just rage
1451894279 he quit ? i just went to get some water

1451896991 final boss of the internet , hes a hard one , gl hf destiny

1451930994 destiny tweeted a bomb threat @ cox : url
1451930995 nathandubs1 nathandubs2 nathandubs2 nathandubs3
1451931001 l-lewd . thanks momo ouo
1451931025 how mucgh longer is left in this game ?
1451931026 with a soft spoken ' allaku akbar '
1451931062 i mean , a twitter suspension seems better than an arrest for making bomb threats .
1451931064 destiny didnt send momo
1451931069 i mean to be fair
1451931074 he's made a few bomb threats
1451931077 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
1451931078 it isnt the first time lol
1451931080 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) /
1451931081 steven bonnel is not found on twitter
1451931089 holy fuck how did he get his twitter suspended frankerz
1451931105 i think 12 hours is pretty kind for a bomb threat
1451931109 told cox he's going to blow up their i fracture
1451931121 what infrastructure ? kappa
1451931124 @allyofjustice it's because he has a lot of followers i bet
1451931126 cool thing about long war- it is literally impossible for him to finish this campaign before xcom 2 comes out .
1451931128 he coulda actually bombed them
1451931129 you mean the telegram wires ?
1451931137 like the internet studf
1451931138 destiny i'm fucking disappointed , i'm so fucking disappointed in you . if you're gonna make a bomb threat can you pls go through with it . don't just say things and then not do them .
1451931141 bomb em with memes
1451931154 why was his twitter suspended ?
1451931162 @robomullet yeah i think so too . if you don't have more than a couple of thousands followers you will probably get permanent banned for something like that
1451931172 i rememberu from chat !
1451931177 i wonder if this will be the first known instance of a streamer swatting himself ?
1451931182 contention is 2 things trying to utilize the same resource
1451931189 does anyone know why is his twitter suspended ?
1451931201 yeah i defended you that debate that got you banned kappa
1451931208 can you make a ! twitter
1451931209 yeah i remmbmer , thank you
1451931212 a lot of people defended me actually
1451931219 just that destiny has brainwashed people to hate me now heheheh
1451931223 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
1451931223 @kurgosh he's been training for this moment with all of these cs memes

1451931287 yeah fuck rtba kappa
1451931287 he unbanned people every year for christmas
1451931295 im not one of those lakers lol
1451931299 im banned from everything destiny
1451931307 merry christmas you shits , try not to get banned this year
1451931311 this was an oversight lel
1451931323 im banned from his twitter too
1451931335 which chat is overlayed on the stream ?
1451931339 woah youre such a bad boy :o
1451931354 how much of a shitter do you have to be for destiny to ban you from everything
1451931374 lul lisawrd ... didn't you comment on every post destiny did on reddit after you got banned ?
1451931414 destiny if only you had a mobile
1451931423 allyofjustice okay so basically destiny got the impression that i was the leader of some sort of cult that kept downvoting everything he said and shitposting him
1451931434 this is the real chat . destiny.gg chat is for memesters who want to feel special . opieop
1451931437 but that was a half truthm a lot of times it was random people shitting on him and i just joined in
1451931440 lakers656 , there is an app
1451931471 rudeful i dunno man i just like chatted with him once on ts
1451931471 i don't think i've ever seen destiny with hair so ... neat before .
1451931472 yes for maximum autism
1451931477 why did stephen's twitter get suspended
1451931482 is right to cuck arms still a noob ? or was he promoted ?
1451931483 i mean he bans a lot of people for barely any reason so plenty of people have reason to downvote his shit
1451931487 url this is why
1451931513 allyofjustice he thinks that it's all me and laukys
1451931536 how did destiny cuxed on twitter ?
1451931546 yeah but its probably my fault that everyone started getting banned for no reason kappa
1451931548 he bangered ur mum ^^
1451931549 so ... 12 hour twitter ban ?
1451931551 because of kelly jjean or what ?
1451931558 lakers656 , if you are on android and search destiny you should find it
1451931580 was it for his call to jihad on cox ?

1451931982 @randocchi can you add a ! twitter so people stop asking about it
1451931997 i cant do shit with the bot
1451932002 this game looks pretty boring shazbotstix youwhy shazbotstix youwhy
1451932008 this game is spooky
1451932027 i came here for memes , will i find memes
1451932027 daren is going to fucking kill everyone in the squad
1451932075 there is already a meme for that in /r/xcom " that's xcom baby "
1451932095 thats why you bring big rockets in and just prefire everything first kappa
1451932141 i wanna suck thorin off tbh
1451932168 smoke gives 20% cover , basically half cover , and you definitely dont want ot face an outsider in half cover , destiny got caught with pants down
1451932193 smoking increases your chance to die by 40%
1451932194 ⎠⎝⎠ ice⎠⎝⎠⎝ e⎠⎝⎠⎝ e
1451932223 but your chance to die is already 100% ...
1451932233 chances for dying is pretty much %100 for everyone though . it might only make it sooner
1451932250 in earlier xcoms you could destroy everything , progress right there
1451932269 could even destroy whole ship if wanted
1451932280 but hey , graphics > gameplay
1451932297 damn xcom from 1997 > this kappa
1451932300 hi destiny , i would like to thank you on behalf of the wesboro baptist church for all the support and dedication you showed to our community . keep those donation money coming boy ! stay autistic and god bless .
1451932313 @destiny , i think momo is watching agdq
1451932325 it's westboro you cancerous fuck syro21
1451932326 momo is there speedrunning
1451932333 there is a game called xenonauts which is a mix between old xcoms and this
1451932339 looks more like the old ones though
1451932347 who else just finished the kaceytron awards ?
1451932360 ups typo , mea culpa baby
1451932360 i dunno but for me 3rd sequel xcom apocalypse was best
1451932363 this music soothes my autism kappa
1451932368 ah i've seen that one
1451932373 mangomosh , i'll allow it
1451932384 what can you possibly speed run when you're 13 years old ? call of duty ? kappa
1451932384 17 , thanks kappakingprime :)
1451932392 can we mute mango mosh ?
1451932399 get your sight checked noob
1451932407 never land 1/3 shots feelsbadman
1451932410 hes still using rifles huh .
1451932438 thats an evac at best , probably a wipe though
1451932446 i just got a max level sniper kreygasm
1451932457 them 100 aim snipers with double tab
1451932462 12 is this game even against other players ?
1451932481 yes the other player is controlling the aliums kappa
1451932495 the other player is also a computer
1451932521 what happened to twatter
1451932523 just storm in and rip him apart
1451932526 @spooky_turtle_wang that would actually be pretty cool
1451932539 destiny went full anele on twitter
1451932550 holy shit he hit something
1451932567 what are the odds
1451932601 6 i make the countdown dansgame
1451932601 you can kill it
1451932606 nade it and then run the other guy
1451932611 opieop he wants to land a 55% shot
1451932617 you had a better spot for the nade
1451932659 1m spooky_turtle_wang : 77% = your past text
1451932668 wish he missed kappa
1451932696 this game is retarded
1451932708 quite a pickle you're in now , mate
1451932739 just let him die , they deserve it
1451932747 the calculation of percentage on this game is stupid . who would miss from a distance like that ...
1451932760 is this new hearthstone dlc ? kappa
1451932762 its a brutal existence fighting against the alien invasion feelsbadman
1451932766 the useful people die
1451932793 i wanna be next on team
1451932830 wow . it got shot
1451932906 did you play the game on normal first ?
1451932913 i mean without lw
1451932916 this might actualy work if game wasnt turn based
1451932941 what wrong with bomb threats ? anele
1451932974 daren the misser minglee
1451933003 destny just watched your rant on youtube about sjw's . i love you .

1451933138 how stupid is that
1451933170 run up and execture
1451933206 i cant beleve how they cant make good xcom these days , only thing they improve are graphics , but gameplay gets dumbed down
1451933273 33% kia rate feelsbadman
1451933288 but havent they fixed some of the issues on xcom 2 that this one has
1451933319 come join our beautiful chat at www.destiny.gg - subscription optional , sign in with your twitch.tv account ! bit.ly/destinygg
1451933329 btw why he is suspended on twitter ?
1451933329 but its kinda unfortunate its xcom 2 : the terrorist dream the game
1451933335 what version is this
1451933344 why do bad things happen to good people feelsbadman
1451933345 for being a terrorist and wanting to bomb stuff
1451933364 its expansion for xcom enemy uknown
1451933364 but destiny is white he can't be terrorist elegiggle
1451933383 yeah , but i don't get 3 skills on promotion
1451933400 everyone who is against goverment is a terrorists elegiggle
1451933407 i was just watching someone do this challenge but limiting themselves to ballistic weapons only .
1451933410 said by a goverment kappa
1451933489 are we on month 2 ? pogchamp
1451933522 build workshops or missions
1451933525 you can get engineers from quests , from having low terror levels in certain countries , by building workshops
1451933537 can aliens atack your base ?
1451933548 think late game yeah
1451933559 but thats like 100+ hours from this
1451933562 destiny don't read twitch chat , don't waste your time
1451933579 go to his page and talk there
1451933603 its from the mission you extracted from
1451933617 where you pussied out
1451933618 he does read this chat you nog
1451933640 is there a static defense turret system you can build beside elevators so when they atack you , they get rekt ?
1451933645 he does read the chat but there is rarely anything worthy being said in here
1451933648 would you guys sex destiny ?
1451933653 that's why he show his chat and not the twitch chat ? kappa
1451933657 i got this game but lazy to install ... :)
1451933676 i just dont wonan waste my time if it isnt as good as old xcoms
1451933689 i mean , i played original series but heard its pretty dumbed down
1451933695 this game is realy good
1451933697 like you cant buy or sell weapons etc
1451933705 anyone think bitcoin will be relevant in daily life ?
1451933706 it's preeeeety decent .. after you get mecs
1451933718 so no economy and cant really chose your equipement no matter how random that might be
1451933732 like equip all with rocket lunchers on instance
1451933762 after month 6 or so
1451933771 i wish it was real time ..
1451933786 what really bothers me is that the game chooses what class the rookie will come out
1451933794 old xcoms , didnt have it but 3rd one apocalypse was awesome cause of realtime
1451933808 stupid af cuz one i got like 5 snipers and no assault
1451933817 anyone know why this happens : when i watch destiny on my desktop , which is much better than my laptop , the video stutters at source quality . on my laptop , however , its all smooth . can someone tell me what is going on and how to fix it ?
1451933823 don't clump up your people , the aliens love throwing grenades
1451933825 the aliens keep getting stronger because of long war's new alien resource system
1451933835 i lost so many high level guys to lame nades
1451933856 grenades ? more like nuclear warheads
1451933868 alles im blick forsensheffy
1451933882 @gawntlet does it buffer or stutters ? if latter then probably your cpu/gpu is too old
1451933922 try upgrading your gpu drivers
1451933928 wouldn't it be cpu/gpu since he has no buffering at all on laptop , so wouldn't be connection problem ?
1451933936 laptop has the integrated chip and its smooth there . desktop has a gpu from last year
1451933946 i think its the one before 980 came out
1451933973 no idea , my computer is from 2012 and works great
1451933978 what does ironman do ?
1451933985 why is he suspended from twatter ?
1451933989 have you tried different browsers ?
1451933992 gets you one save
1451933998 move your guys against the wall infront of you
1451934004 do a decision tree coolcat
1451934011 imagine you have a 5 , 7 off suit , and you see 5 , 8 , 10 on the flop
1451934020 why is his twitter suspended
1451934022 newer gpus from 4 year ago min , have powerfull hardware decoder
1451934035 should work perfect even on 4k videos
1451934056 why is his twitter suspended ?
1451934061 oh and its only twitch 4head youtube videos are fine no matter what
1451934067 cause of this @gungaelpress url

1451934127 @mountmarilyn thanks and lmao
1451934133 sengoesrawr oh ya i forgot to answer you . both firefox and chrome on desktop give me stuttering on twitch . on laptop , its fine on both firefox and chrome
1451934143 destiny i've reported you to the fbi
1451934162 @gawntlet update your video drivers
1451934194 its all going to shit bois
1451934203 what the hell was that sound ? russian jihad ?
1451934234 overwatch out ? pogchamp
1451934248 don't ever move a suppressed guy unless he'sa scout
1451934254 in my experience if you dont kill the aliens fast they all just starting pouring into your flanks
1451934263 my wild guess best tactic is to just wait till they come to you and get rekt by overwatch kappa
1451934282 moonlight sonata is in c# minor guys minglee
1451934284 press f to pay respects
1451934284 overwatch got aim penalty so just w8ing is dumb
1451934324 spaming overwatch in one spot is not a good tactic
1451934335 post on position to get easy kills , but somehow you have penalty for focusing on easy targets kappa
1451934339 @destiny he is using suppresive fire on you thats why
1451934339 how logical is that
1451934343 jayyy_ up to date . still stutters :(
1451934345 people need a free tile next to them to fire
1451934348 he doesn't have a shot because his step-out is blocked by the soldier in half cover
1451934349 gotta make you play agressive and rely on rng
1451934350 xcom has no logic lol
1451934363 and im asking here if i should install this game failfish
1451934375 xcom is beautiful guys dont bully it
1451934382 @gawntlet what kind of video card do you have ? make sure you check drivers manually from the website rather than trusting the auto-update or check-update from the driver software itself
1451934384 theyre suicide units meant to make you scatter
1451934386 coming that i actualy played those diamonds from 199x year
1451934386 ofc they don't have fear
1451934404 but ayy lamo tho guys every game has flaws failfish
1451934438 xcom apocalypse has no flaws
1451934461 why doesn't he use the rocket launcher on the support class ?
1451934462 could expand that game to 10 size and upgrade graphics and would be best xcom ever made
1451934470 and has real time
1451934494 @mountmarilyn i think the word you're looking for is rts .
1451934499 granates in this game must have been nerfed , you dont stand that close to an exploding granate
1451934506 well it also had micro managment
1451934524 well that would leave it without the elements that make it xcom :o
1451934539 which allowed freedom to equip many kinds of weapons , or just overpower ufos just by air power , not even do tactical missions
1451934545 he grenades are pretty bad on anything that's not an engineer
1451934550 although you had to though
1451934557 oh fuck i think its frozen
1451934564 i got that alien activity glitch before
1451934582 game froze ? lol
1451934584 nah , you just cant see some of them moving
1451934623 yea dude its a common glitch
1451934639 that guy froze time
1451934643 it blows horse dick when it happens

1451937731 lower the difficulty and take off ironman
1451937732 that seems decent latency
1451937740 maybe you should lower the difficultayh desnity
1451937750 @lakers656 , he's playing because those things exist , he will never lower it .
1451937757 dusty only goes balls deep
1451937763 i dont understand the csgo hype
1451937767 i love tuning in to see destiny ignore cover mechanics
1451937771 even when comparing to other fps's it's not that great
1451937773 long war on impossible is not even fun to play lol
1451937775 the thing is he will never beat it on this hard it's not beatable
1451937783 he's never going to scratch the surface of long war because of all the horrible decisions he makes
1451937824 @lakers656 , that's cool , he still won't change it .
1451937839 destiny is a hardcore gamer
1451937844 is z still the best race ?
1451937848 destiny wont ban us in twitch chat we are the true believers
1451937848 i dont wanna see him beat it fishmoley
1451937866 he won't ever beat it
1451937897 long war was made by some asshat who didnt like using snipers so he nerfed them and didnt make any other plays viable
1451937899 it would be impressive if he got laserweapons before cuckcom 2 comes out
1451937913 impossible long war has a ton of unfair stuff
1451937960 where can i see destinys play list ?
1451937990 why is destiny's twitter account suspended ?

1451938137 @curtsy , no they purposely avoid banning isis accoutns because they feel its easier to track them that way instead of pushing them deeper

1451938194 did we give up on the xcom ?
1451938200 also , you really surprised he got his twitter suspended for making a bomb threat towards a major coporation ?

1451938587 lol dat ban duckez
1451938589 literally thousands of lost dollars cause ' of cux
1451938593 i'd be salty too
1451938609 cox reported his twitter that's why he got banned duckerz if it was just some few fags that reported the tweet they wouldn't care
1451938612 cux = cox + cuck
1451938621 nickname for cox communications , his isp that cucks him
1451938625 destiny was just 3 edgy 5 twitter
1451938637 bomb threats are like equivalent threat level to shootings now its risque to say it
1451938641 they might think ur isis
1451938663 if you disagree with the automated twitter ban then you support isis kappa
1451938691 does he really only have one internet option ?
1451938692 this looks like starcraft on speed
1451938697 destiny.gg - world's end girlfriend - der spiegel im spiegel im spiegel
1451938712 feel bad for you guys locked into one isp
1451938718 that shit aint right
1451938728 i can get six or seven different ones
1451938731 @ponzini , 99% of the u.s. has only one internet option . unless you want painfully slow speeds
1451938736 free market is pretty good
1451938745 the monopoly is real
1451938759 thats just the free market in action kappa
1451938762 motherland of the www
1451938767 monopolys plus the us being fucking huge
1451938773 will destinys twitter ever get unbanned ? or is it permanent ?
1451938777 i think it's over m8
1451938784 12h ban twitter ban
1451938792 12h twitter ban *
1451938793 only 12 ? thats not bad
1451938798 you killed the bot
1451938801 no . but it's funny
1451938816 its only a prank bro anele
1451938835 whats the official reason of his ban ?
1451938844 made a bomb threat
1451938858 agile is such a retard
1451938859 destiny hasn't confirmed as far as i know
1451938864 who is this guy ?
1451938868 and i doubt twitter has said anything
1451938872 who is he playing against ? >
1451938883 is this the map hack fag ?
1451938883 i hope destiny crushes this homo
1451938903 go destiny ! you got this bitch .
1451938906 destiny is too rusty to beat this guy , its already gg like he said
1451938908 doesnt know who deezer is dansgame
1451938909 why is destiny so angry ? agile is just a troll
1451938909 why are there so many map hackers ?
1451938916 just being stubborn cause hes mad
1451938920 just google deezer youll see
1451938921 it's easy and almost risk free
1451938924 because people like winning
1451938926 @naltron , because it's starcraft .
1451938949 when is the last time blizzard banned a high profile map hacker ? probably never
1451938967 last time ? when's the first time ? kappa
1451938971 sc2 is a dead game ofc theyre not gonna waste time banning some map hacker
1451938978 deezer is a toss player though
1451938986 hey zerg players in here . i just started with lotv . 12 drones lol . my openers are all broken . will 17/17/17 safe against t and p ?
1451938987 botting in wow was mega easy too
1451938989 deezer switched to league
1451938993 almost got in the lcs too lol
1451938997 blizz are shit at banning
1451939002 yeh but they still do ban waves on bots and improve bot detection
1451939014 blizz actually did a pretty huge bot ban a couple weeks ago for wow
1451939020 yeah wow is a cash cow so they're better at protecting it
1451939034 and 99% of those people promptly went out and bought new accounts just like blizzard wants
1451939036 no shit , blizzard are a company they want to make money
1451939040 i did bot for two and a half years without any issues though
1451939058 what is the leave league bug ?
1451939059 is it ? \\
1451939061 you guys do realize , the opponent is actually top 50 gm right ??
1451939067 cmon beat this cunt
1451939071 what happened last game ? missed end
1451939075 agile is such a dipshit
1451939077 you can leave your league and get infinite mmr
1451939078 @iamthe_end , yup , but only 50 people still play sc2
1451939081 @heliummuppet , leave league and your mmr inflates
1451939102 are there just 2 people playing or what , 3rd in a row
1451939117 i don't see the lag
1451939122 8ms lagging so bad
1451939133 this shittalk is low but with an edge
1451939134 destiny press ctrl + alt + f to see your ingame latency
1451939145 why is destiny fighting all the time . cant he be happy :)
1451939148 huk would still complain about 8ms , its the only thing he can do instead of admitting he is shit now
1451939149 knife i tell you
1451939150 i love allchat kreygasm
1451939151 ctrl alt f = sc2 latency
1451939161 i like the new serene steven , it relaxes me !
1451939164 naltron sc2 is a fighting game
1451939165 naltron , he feeds of of negative vibes
1451939180 he cant win by being peaceful
1451939182 sign of a mediocre player , complains about things being out of control at every opportunity , see it with na players blaming scripts all the time on lol
1451939201 @fubick not true . look at neuro :) he hugs ppl win or lose
1451939209 im scared of neuro tbh
1451939218 neuro does get annoyed at times
1451939220 @eddfir lol . who blames scripts ?
1451939229 @naltron did you see that video on yt where he fights his alter ego with a keyboard in a forest lmao
1451939238 @eddfir i mean , if you're playing against a script it's pretty awful .
1451939241 @hydralinsk no haha where can i find it
1451939246 @milo109 , bjerg , dl at least , i don't watch na pros much , too much shitty rap and poor play
1451939254 @eddfir but i dont think i've ever seen one in a game ive played
1451939256 @hydralinsk im guessing everyone on that pro gaming house hes at locks their doors to sleep xd
1451939261 i like the guy . but hes scary
1451939276 @robomullet , yeh but they literally blame scripts in 1/5 games , 0 chance that proportion of high end players use those
1451939281 na pros are the worst lol streamers imo
1451939298 it's super obvious when there is a scripter
1451939301 @eddfir who are you referring to ? i don't know many pros who do that tbh
1451939308 its fucking crazy how people watch league streamers
1451939313 i dont play this game . but a friend told me that if i know how to play league of legends this game will be easy to learn
1451939321 they have such a bad attitude , good players always blame themselves when things go wrong because thats the attitude you need to compete
1451939324 someone like dyrus was getting like 30k viewers like what the fuck
1451939325 @naltron your friend is an idiot
1451939334 the most uncharismatic and boring people
1451939336 naltron , yes spend the money 100% worth it all the expo to
1451939341 yet they get insane amount of viewers
1451939342 it's because of memes dude
1451939345 @robomullet , dl = doublelift , bjerg = bjergsen
1451939348 memes are the future
1451939353 gold league = gm sc2 ive been told
1451939367 that's fucking hilarious .
1451939371 you're not even funny
1451939373 league of legends streams in general are really unenjoyable
1451939380 come up with some new shit
1451939381 ders . link/m8hah xd
1451939384 i fucking hated when destiny played league it was unwatchable
1451939387 atleast try to be a little funny when you're trolling @naltron
1451939388 @kamakasa do you like league of legends ?
1451939390 not a fucking retard
1451939398 @kamakasa , some streamers are good , but a lot just shove in shit music and endless donation cock sucking
1451939398 @eddfir if you're arguing the bjergson can't compete , than you're taking the wrong tack
1451939404 hey is dayz good ?
1451939418 did they added cars yet ?

1451939458 i used to play league but the game just became too shit for me to handle
1451939477 idk i played it for like a good year or so and followed the comp scene
1451939484 league of legends is a good game , as long as you don't play or watch it
1451939501 league has been improving in quality consistently , the developers are solid , you probably just got bored if you think its gotten worse gameplay wise
1451939505 inb4 destiny bm's agile if he wins
1451939514 are you kidding ?
1451939519 the fucking juggernaut bullshit they did
1451939522 and the hud changes
1451939522 agile is a piece of shit
1451939522 i just visited agile's channel , so much bm and cancerous it's amazing . do not visit under any circumstances .
1451939524 lol lol devs are solid kappa
1451939526 what happened to xcom ?
1451939544 > tfw no more xcom
1451939545 he is just a cheecky bugger
1451939547 agile is a bm shitty
1451939547 did he get wiped again
1451939554 the problem with lol its the community .. but like 80% are kids so ..
1451939565 if you have a basic understanding of the game design it has now compared to 1-2 years ago then it has improved massively , if you honestly think jugs are op you dont know how to play the game even half well
1451939569 being bm is pretty funny
1451939574 its all ogre now
1451939576 yeah lol the league reddit is crazy
1451939577 just like how destiny can be funny when he goes autistic
1451939596 here comes the bm . called it !
1451939597 wheres my bois phone call to the baws
1451939599 i had 2 accounts in diamond 1 ive never been below plat
1451939605 i like how riot abandoned the majority of their promises like infrastructure upgrades and improvements they promised what 2 years ago ?
1451939606 there are so many good games
1451939608 on euw and ne
1451939615 there's no need to play league in all of your life
1451939621 im 100 % sure i understand and play the game better than you
1451939622 i love his response lol

1451939686 5th time in a row
1451939686 3 jugs had a 55% winrate for a while yes , if you were using that as a reason for league becoming shit in general then youre just trolling

1451939696 wtf is a juggernauts
1451939696 hes playing with 250 poing ?

1451939743 the game became so fucking uninvidualistic and it became impossible to carry
1451939756 @newguycommentary legit ban or mod with god complex ?
1451939758 you shouldn't ask during the salt ask at the start of a stream instead
1451939764 destiny.gg - bonobo - black sands
1451939766 you can taste just the tip on screen @newguycommentary
1451939774 naltron , well i think if i say rtba u know the answer
1451939779 as a wood leaguer i think eddfir knows what he is talking about
1451939801 obviously the accounts are not diamond 1 now because of the lp decay thing
1451939802 this video is amazing
1451939807 i hate watching agile zerg playing . that dude spams so hard . that its annoying
1451939807 i dont respect anyone who likes nicklebaack
1451939812 hes like the spam good
1451939820 this video is hilarious , they use jets to speak to god more frequently
1451939820 i dont want to get triggered destiny please mute this so this steam can remain my safe space

1451939840 well agile was listneing to it
1451939847 and i got banned for calling him a *** for listening to it
1451939847 @hendrix_3 , he plays nickelback because of people like you
1451939855 he's gotta keep himself occupied with spamming . we cant all multitask like destiny and read reddit , eat a sandwhich and fuck our girlfriends while sc2
1451939856 wtf are we listening to
1451939858 @eddfir its hilarious though
1451939864 you have to believe
1451939874 the book of anus
1451939875 tbh hating nioickelback is just a stupid 9fag meme
1451939881 i want donalt trump to win !
1451939888 i really dont know what 9fag is
1451939890 when destiny loses this one its because he was distracted by the video just so everyone is aware in advance to avoid getting rage banned
1451939893 the book of nickelback
1451939898 im from latin america and i support donalt trump
1451939900 wat thu hell in damn tarnation
1451939901 what the fuck am i listening to
1451939916 agreed mangomosh , nickelback has some bad song and some good songs , not worse than other bands
1451939933 mangomosh i thought people actually hated nickelback and it wasn'ta meme elegiggle
1451939934 we need dem million dollar jets
1451939936 its all generic songs theyre terrible
1451939945 ders . link/m8hah lol

1451939956 @chaoticsync , its not a meme . they actually suck ass
1451939963 @destiny hey man , i dont know if this has been asnwered yet but why is your twitter account frozed ?
1451939965 nickelback is just a generic rock band like dozen others
1451939968 babyrage i hate memes babyrage
1451939968 @hendrix_3 , if you have a real opinion on a band you're already infected by the memes
1451939968 but others dont get hated
1451939974 i admit they arent exactly geniuses , but they dont deserve the shit they get on the internet
1451939980 face it you it like memes
1451939981 no matter what im fucked
1451939989 ye real opinions dont exist , either you go with the meme or youre against it
1451939990 these guys use religion for their benefit on a next level . most people try to look poor while swimming in cash , these guys pretend god is speaking to them because they are flying in private jets
1451939992 burself_in_5 , nice name burself_in_5

1451940806 destiny.gg - re : plus - overcome feat . butta p & gigi
1451940806 booom ! where are the virgins ?
1451940811 @littleburn99 it raises your mmr
1451940816 you can leave your league and then mmr is super high when you get upto platinum or something and winning makes other gm lose massive points
1451940818 littleburn99 leave league , press matchmaking , play gms kappa // thats it
1451940822 @littleburn99 and you lose no points
1451940841 from a preacher to a 14 year old rapper ?
1451940850 basedgod / \\ trihard
1451940850 whaaaa sounds broken ? o.o
1451940850 you leave league and your mmr gets reset to hugh gm but the barcode he played was not abusing that
1451940851 nathanias was platinum after he left league and was playing against destiny , destiny got 1 point for winning
1451940855 according to the other chat this is a white rapper
1451940864 did he win ?
1451940878 destiny.gg - re : plus - overcome feat . butta p & gigi
1451940881 destiny was converted by that guy on youtube
1451940889 his channel is so awful it's almost unbelievable . apparently he'sa serious nickleback stan ? how is that even fucking possible ?
1451940889 yeah so troll gms are making new accounts , throwing their placement matches to get to low mmr , then leaving league
1451940899 then they fight gms , end up beating a few and steal huge amounts of points
1451940910 im not sure destiny can get converted considering his mother
1451940921 so why dosent destiny play on a smurf and do the same ?
1451940924 then thats a huge bug on how that works
1451940939 and hurts the people who have worked hard to get where they are
1451940940 but he can lose 25 points for no reason
1451940942 maybe he make blizzard notice it faster kappa
1451940944 the leave league bug is dumb because it doesn't help you . it just hurts others
1451940945 how does one leave league ?
1451940960 you don't get higher rank , you just attempt to tank other's chances of it
1451940963 you go into your starcraft folder and delete all the files and then burn your computer @littleburn99
1451940963 destiny.gg - re : plus - overcome feat . butta p & gigi
1451940969 pacjax is your account banned ?
1451940990 that's the fastest way to leave league kappa
1451941006 just uninstall league of legends works too
1451941006 luisftwxd nope just cant login currently i think twitch changed my password or something cuz my phones remembered password doesnt work anymore

1451943269 incontrol just throwing away zealots into spines
1451943270 comparing beta to now is pointless though . i was diamond and i never played ladder wc3 or any other strategy game .
1451943276 dcmccoy it depends if he has ! stalk on or something
1451943276 hey destiny , are we gonna watch the donation ?
1451943279 why veto ulrena if you have 60% wr ?
1451943285 wasnt he rank 26 ?
1451943305 han solo lives forever thats a spoilr
1451943310 dcmccoy i dont watch his stream so if you do look me up it should be the only thing i said
1451943314 anyone here see the new starwars movie ??
1451943318 " leave league bug " player was making him lose tons of points
1451943328 omg i just realised why they call it archon mode , it all makes sense now :o shiiiiit
1451943330 maybe he loses on ulrena to cheese and tired of it or loses too many points regardless there
1451943332 someone linked a video about avilo and jason going at it
1451943335 mynoobaccount , ill try but if it takes longer than 5min i will give up , aint nobody got time for that
1451943339 the disadvantage of having a massive dick is you can get fucked in the urethra .
1451943364 destiny.gg - hans zimmer - waiting for a train
1451943386 did he say what he was going for with the nexus ?
1451943397 destiny.gg - hans zimmer - waiting for a train
1451943397 why no xcom destiny ???
1451943402 just seemed like a good idea at the time 4head
1451943402 dcmccoy let me know if you find it i want to fucking show how low he really is
1451943403 just for the bm to shit all over incontrol
1451943408 @thrice yo i think this guy is viewbotting tbh
1451943432 destiny doesnt need to viewbot lol
1451943438 he said on twitter that he advocates viewbotting too !
1451943443 mrdestructoid my names im_not_black_but and im a certified autist mrdestructoid
1451943447 " no reason not to do it "
1451943457 after playing soma , are we really that differnt from bots
1451943462 i like how steven doesn't realize that all his viewers are me on different accounts . dont believe me ? watch me post this on my other accounts
1451943473 mynoobaccount , so far google gives me the most random results , i doubt ill ever find logs
1451943477 traiborn what ? the game of the year more like
1451943477 @kingofpromise , i think he gets an extra 800 viewers from bots and shit , but its not him so it doesnt really matter
1451943492 lol thats the point
1451943494 @gawntlet game wasnt scary , more lame and residentsleeper than anything
1451943496 im_not_black_but , nice b8 m8 ir8 8/8
1451943500 @destiny do you like rage against the machine ?
1451943504 destinys always had this many viewers . he doesnt get view botted
1451943507 but thats just my opinion dont let it keep you up at night bruh
1451943514 dcmccoy its not that big of a deal really , no one watches him so there is no point on calling him out
1451943526 ya but no game is realllly scary tbh xd . i just loved the story . i know it was something whoa orginal but i think it was executed really well
1451943540 it wasnt original i mean *
1451943543 tool is the hsit
1451943548 destiny , your early 20's ? that was like a decade ago kappa you old fuck
1451943571 forty-two and six is on that
1451943571 rekt tool likers elegiggle
1451943572 destiny.gg - hans zimmer - waiting for a train
1451943590 tool is my favorite band . seeing them live in about 3 weeks . deal with it kappa
1451943591 i do like a good enema
1451943598 tool is awesome , there's much more to them than what you give credit
1451943618 they started as a mock band not sure what you expect
1451943624 an enema should be a part of everyones daily hygiene routine
1451943628 being a teen in the 90s , tool was a great change from grunge . plus the live shows where worth it
1451943630 tool is for tools elegiggle
1451943638 enemas are healthy as fuck , i once had a bunch of them when i had a bleeding ulcer in my stomach
1451943638 10000000 day is ma jaaam
1451943641 ders . link/m8hah xd
1451943646 lolwat don't know what drugs this guy is on
1451943651 tool fans are getting rekt as fk
1451943658 link me to destiny twitter
1451943663 tool's percussionist isn't talented ? that's the dumbest shit i've ever heard
1451943666 tool's drummer best percussionist of the 20th century hands down
1451943676 im not a huge tool fan , but seriously . that's an ignorant statement
1451943680 tool is for verysmart people lul
1451943685 someone who clearly doesnt know much about music
1451943690 @pandavore47 gtfo scum , soad's drummer shits all over tools drummer elegiggle
1451943696 stick to judging games destiny
1451943701 he knows a fair bit about music
1451943709 nah , i super respect destiny's music knowledge like 99% of the time , i just think he's wrong about this one
1451943710 i think grr martin shouldnt have told hbo the complete story . make them fucking wait for the novels . greedy fks
1451943713 not sure if you don't tune in that often , but meh
1451943717 tool is guud morduck
1451943718 i think you should argue over skype with density
1451943728 meh as someone who's been drumming for 13 years , i wouldn't say carey sucks lol
1451943728 why do we deserve the seasons consistent ; y
1451943729 @gawntlet , i agree
1451943730 dcmccoy incrontol is streaming right now i believe if you were to type in his chat ! stalk then my name it should come up
1451943745 @gawntlet the books were kreygasm the show is kinda residentsleeper imo
1451943758 my cat meows when i choke it am i choking it the wrong way ?
1451943759 how long is the stream delay ?
1451943760 muta v terran ? rip
1451943762 i think he told hbo the story so he wouldn't have to put any effort into writing the books
1451943764 @traiborn i like soad's drummer a lot dont get me wrong , he is not a bad player he has excellent talent , i just think tool's percussionist was better
1451943768 books and show are both kreygasm but books are more kreygasm
1451943771 man , gotta scroll through all kinds of games until i get to dead as fuck sc2 kappa
1451943784 dcmccoy if that doesnt work you can try something else but please send me the logs if you can
1451943791 why would u read books in 2016 ? do u still make fires with sticks like cavemen ?
1451943808 what rapper is this
1451943812 destiny.gg - nujabes - eclipse ( feat . substantial )
1451943812 @dicedlemming i read them back in 2009-2010 fool elegiggle
1451943817 its the black one

1451943833 but nujabes makes up for this rapper
1451943834 nothing is happening when i go ! stalk
1451943842 books improve your vocabulary , comprehension and articulation of if you read out loud . rekt

1451943932 traiborn , who ? i dont even think beyonce or halle barry are hot , i rather fuck a chubby white girl
1451943940 only lightskins can be attractive
1451943943 chubby white girl opieop
1451943945 my entire family agrees wth that statement feelsbadman
1451943946 i'll talk to you sonah failfish

1451943976 dude can you ask him to pull up the logs lol
1451943978 fat people r physically repulsive .. like seeing a centipede on ur wall or somethign
1451943984 @dcmccoy girls i went to school with , 1 in hs and like 2 in college . i still remember them to this day because hot black girls are so rare you should put them in a fucking zoo elegiggle
1451943991 this song = pls give da succ i pay u
1451944004 destiny.gg - sufjan stevens - all the trees of the field will clap their hands
1451944005 a black girl touched my penis once and i gained 8 inches on my 5 inc penis
1451944019 actually i think the centipede is a beautiful creature as well as bbw's
1451944031 destiny.gg - sufjan stevens - all the trees of the field will clap their hands
1451944037 traiborn , you should pitch that idea to congress , much more humane than torturing animals by keeping them in captivity , because black people are not organic , they are abominations
1451944040 am i right ?
1451944045 black women are wutface
1451944049 i think black girls are hot as fuck
1451944058 omg i just tuned into agdq and cringed so hard that i have to see a doctor
1451944059 k1ash3r , thats why you should die right now
1451944072 blacks are just former slaves . send them back to the congo
1451944091 honestly , black girl dont look good at all
1451944098 so many hate and racism failfish trihard
1451944100 i dont know how anyone can find them attractive
1451944108 speaking of ethnicity the most recent girl i had sex with was a navajo although i was kinda disappointed when i found out cuz i was god damn sure she was asian
1451944110 it's 2016 can you guys stop being racist towards women and minorities
1451944110 i'm so triggered right now kappa
1451944111 djac_sc2 , not racism , its biology
1451944114 this music works well with weed , very calming
1451944114 the only hot black girls always have some white in them
1451944121 every black girl ive touched had super smooth skin
1451944123 its almost like different people like different things or something
1451944129 @ship_it_holla_ballas , baited lul
1451944131 some black women look good , like 1/100
1451944135 ship dis sum shit tier b8 m8
1451944138 destiny.gg - sufjan stevens - all the trees of the field will clap their hands
1451944138 black chicks are kinda gross , but some people fetishize and like them , kinda like how some people eat poo sexually
1451944140 k1ash3r , because black people use lotion every day , because their skin gets ashy so quick
1451944142 the swarm pogchamp !
1451944144 their skin is faulty
1451944147 some people in this chat look good , like 1/100
1451944158 is this avioli ?
1451944160 i am the 99% kappa
1451944162 can someone ban dcmccoy for trolling and baiting constantly
1451944165 i think all white men should be required to get at least one black woman pregnant in their life time to create a superior milk chocolate master race
1451944172 dicedlemming , i can send you a pic if you want , im super cute
1451944172 im a fat neckbeard , i rate myself as 9/10 on looks scale 4head
1451944174 wtf is is this awful noise failfish
1451944179 some people eat poo ? i know a lot like to watch the shit come out . for example , to be shit on
1451944186 k1ash3r , dont take the bait :d
1451944186 21dahoagie12 this song is indeed triggering me now
1451944188 but dcmccoy is a nice guy seemsgood
1451944206 k1ash3r , im not trolling , im serious , i never saw a black girl who i would fuck voluntarily , not even beyonce or halle barry
1451944209 @dcmccoy opposite actually , darker skinned people produce more sea balm , their skin naturally moistens due to more skin pigmentation ( melanin )
1451944212 @prokeyboard yea some people like that but i had to think of an act more comparable to being into black chicks
1451944213 i think they are mediocre at best
1451944214 @gawntlet , i want to know who the fuck sat in the studio and could stomach this shit for more than 30 seconds without shooting himself failfish
1451944224 @dcmccoy lighter skinned people need more lotion
1451944225 @dcmccoy , not even lightskin bitches ?
1451944251 @dcmccoy , fair enough then
1451944251 beyonce is a dumb horse looking bitch
1451944252 thank fucking god that awful song is over

1451944310 crashing banes into thors elegiggle
1451944318 maybe the first attacking unit zerg can make can beat units that cost 200+ gas and minerals 4head
1451944328 what are these games
1451944339 as a terran player , i actually admit terran can be pretty op lategame

1451944343 @destiny is marinelord the next bonjwa ?
1451944347 would broodlord siege work here ?
1451944359 liberators , flying siege tanks , are very retarded
1451944365 why would he make broodlords , when zerg has no anti air ability vs mass vikings ?
1451944373 new starwars movie sucked
1451944374 finally a terran admitted it kappa
1451944383 anyone remember the shredder ? apparently that was replaced by the widow mine
1451944394 destiny twitter banned ?
1451944400 f3nwick2 but luke looked so sexeh
1451944401 what's with all the mines and thors ol
1451944403 f3nwick2 , yes it did , even the old 3 starwars movies were a 7.5 /10 at best
1451944411 never got why star wars is so popular
1451944415 @prokeyboard , whoever made both of those units should be lynched
1451944419 just think how much better the white race would be if they were slaves and only the biggest were bred
1451944419 yep his twitter is suspended lol
1451944421 it doesnt touch godfather or goodfellas by a mile
1451944430 ugh the game is already over doe to parasitic bomb

1451945391 it literally sounds the same , same notes , same chords
1451945392 hey there chat . im here for my weekly dose of autism .
1451945397 yeah , theyre all d
1451945400 lol every song is drop d
1451945405 destiny , that's tool in a nutshell
1451945411 nobody bitched when pink floyd did it
1451945414 " its ok "
1451945414 who knows r programmng ?
1451945419 thats how this cd goes , very similar all the way . its supposed to tell the story of his mother whom died of cancer
1451945420 bro dont hate on tool
1451945421 the band is named tool ? wow , how fitting
1451945424 there are some artist , which are pretty monoton
1451945425 wot dansgame brokeback failfish
1451945429 rosetta stoned is like only song that sounds remotely different
1451945438 is it not just an underlying theme they are trying to project ? or is that too sadistic ?
1451945438 people bitch when a band tries to be different
1451945444 the drummer is pretty good imo
1451945445 nearly every guitar-focused band uses the same key for all their songs .
1451945445 @angrytetris why because it focuses on other mechanics other than spending gold to buy items ? bet you couldn't get rank 1 pleb elegiggle
1451945453 thing is , justin chancellor's wal bass sounds so good though
1451945454 skip please . this one is guly
1451945455 destiny.gg - tool - jambi
1451945455 this song has a better chord progression imo
1451945455 its and extension of the previous song
1451945456 i don't get the tool hype , the atmosphere of the songs is great , but it really is the same song over and over again :d
1451945465 its literally the same guitar and drum notes as the last one
1451945469 sounds similar must be shit ? residentsleeper
1451945472 misanthrope are you literally retarded or just pretending ?
1451945473 these people call themselves artists ? smh
1451945475 guys , youtube " riff battles " for some good times
1451945476 i can do better
1451945478 its the same voice too kappa
1451945486 gaiahero , no but it isn't all that interesting :p
1451945496 has rifkin died yet ?
1451945496 roaches counter muta kappaross
1451945501 tool songs are famous for being random as fuck
1451945501 he should play the live version of this song about waffles
1451945506 dead soul tribe is just tool but a twice as good
1451945521 roaches become ravagers which counter muta kappa
1451945527 wow the bridge of this song is so bad , it builds no hype
1451945531 maybe youd prefer bieber ? kappa
1451945531 obvious counter , destiny played right into his trap
1451945547 @zacstarcraft , the chorus chord prog in this song is dope , the fuck are you on about ?
1451945558 i'd like to know what music the people bitching like
1451945558 justin bieber is actually better than tool
1451945566 gaiahero , honestly , even as a heavy critic , biebers new album got some fire beats , its actually decent rnb
1451945567 this album is meant to be listened in chapters : #1 , 2 , 3 , 4 are related . # 6 , 7 , 8 have also the same storyline
1451945582 noone argues with you destiny
1451945591 and dont complain about the worst album they've made xd
1451945591 what was the previous song ?
1451945592 bieber > tool ?! pogchamp
1451945604 i mean , tool writes concept albums , the songs are supposed to be similar :p
1451945608 people that dont understand music wouldnt like this
1451945610 yeah a bunch of cuks voted for 10000 days
1451945616 careful destiny , those hydras could become lurkers and kill ur mutas , as they do really good aoe damage kappa
1451945619 21dahoagie12 , that has nothing to with it
1451945624 don't look at me , i voted aenima :)
1451945628 orange guy going out of his base with his hydra .....
1451945630 f3nwick2 youre a clown
1451945631 riff raff confirmed best rapper of 2015 . dude has the best satire act i've ever heard . litterally shits all over the " rap game "
1451945633 i get the bieber hate until his last album , his last album was actually good rnb to the levels of a luther vandross and gary neville , its good
1451945638 @saynsh , you're right , the fact its all in drop d is what it has to do with kappa
1451945641 this guy dont talk while playing ??
1451945649 tool is best live <3 kreygasm
1451945650 10.000 days is great . just wait for rosetta stoned and right in two
1451945651 alexslayer30 you say that sacestecly but when i look at lol counter they are accualy very good vs muta
1451945655 since when did metal/rock have any interesting musical sounds at all ? its just for angry prepubescents that want to piss off their parents
1451945667 @immakingtoast , those are like only two distinguishable songs on this album
1451945670 make banes , run in , gg
1451945683 a guitar solo ? wtf
1451945688 that interlude is actually not that bad
1451945690 porcupine tree though kreygasm
1451945694 wings for marie ?
1451945695 but the rest of the song is garbo garbo
1451945696 destiny would make a good beta cuck imo
1451945710 destiny is arguing with some imagined entity , while i think most tool fans would agree that the entirety of 10k days is very similar
1451945711 that muta poke is massive
1451945714 suhama you have to be trolling ...
1451945719 tool is music for freaks like me b )
1451945723 destiny realizing that he likes tool lul
1451945731 he's got a good cuck goatee
1451945733 dunno i feel like there are better progressive metal bands out there , even mainstream ones
1451945734 saynsh , these guys actually have fans ?
1451945734 that's because you didn't pick the best album : undertow
1451945738 morgasm92 , nope , he made his decision before this
1451945739 last time i heard anything off this album was when i was in line with my friends to go see primus , one of the radio stations had this playing on the speakers outside
1451945744 alexslayer30 lolcounter does not lie
1451945745 timtumm , you mean opiate ?
1451945757 any1 who says tool is meh , clearly doesn't understand music
1451945769 arabian_night , wow what an argument
1451945770 tool is defintely awesome .
1451945770 dcmccoy , i would count me as a fan so yeah , at least one fan
1451945770 @arabian_night mad cuckster confirmed
1451945771 the worst part of tool is the singer
1451945773 the lead singer makes his own wine now 4head b )
1451945776 if u want a band who's songs don't ever sound the same , listen to rush kreygasm
1451945781 tool is meh lul

1451945898 saynsh , im not judging this based on personal taste , just objectively speaking , this is generic as fuck and holds no artistic value whatsoever , maybe thats bad songs but so far , im not convinced
1451945903 2nd song hype pogchamp
1451945903 and tool isnt that amazing too , pretty long winded and generic metal
1451945905 nirvana has more high ratings than 99% of bands album reviews
1451945908 nirvana isn't bad , but they aren't even on the level of soundgarden

1451945994 dcmccoy , what do you mean objectively speaking , are you trolling ? youre talking about music . just because it doesnt hold any artistic merit to you , doesnt mean it wont hold any merit to someone else .
1451945995 i like most music . come at me chat !
1451945997 mozart didnt even know what a synthesizer is how did he make music
1451946007 arabian_night , true , their unplugged session was so good , its beatles level

1451946056 dicedlemming , well only like 6 ex right ?
1451946059 does tool mean the same shit or is it the name of this artist ?

1451946132 rosetta stoned is best song on this album
1451946135 summiz , im using a voltaxic and tabula rasa and shooting things for almost entirely chaos dmg feelsgoodman
1451946138 tool isnt that amazing , pretty long winded and mostly boring . saw them live , wasnt impressed
1451946139 dicedlemming , my first time playing i went hc and got to 60 and didnt die last league befoe it ended

1451946163 u wot m8 dansgame
1451946164 @cgnglen every single person i spoke with who saw them live jizzed their pants
1451946165 arabian_night , i can agree with that , it isn't generic . but i never could listen to more than one album of them in a row .
1451946165 tune in and of course it'sa zvz match
1451946169 which says a lot
1451946175 poe is the last thing i would have expected in destiny's chat
1451946181 i have to agree with lastigx . this music blows magical unicorns 15ft rainbowy penis .... get some real music / metal in this bitch
1451946187 dcmccoy , theres seriously nothing to discuss , you come across as someone who's already made up your mind . you think theres objectively no merit to music just because it doesnt speak to you .
1451946187 dicedlemming , kappa //
1451946189 @arabian_night , well , maybe you check yourself ^^
1451946190 @eg_idra wtf why are you here ?!
1451946191 i don't like this song , it is so disharmonic .
1451946192 alright this riff is actually kinda hype , but it doesnt follow up with anything valuable
1451946193 poe is the best game ever , destiny should try it out
1451946194 @thisisacer i think you need to have a certain type of music listening style to like tool , i know that sounds weird , but i yhink uou do .
1451946199 dicedlemming , how many deaths pepe
1451946207 @eg_idra wtf why are you here ? ? ?
1451946209 heroin+tool = high school

1451946210 turn the chat off it sounds much better kappa
1451946210 @cgnglen true , my dream is to see them . ive seen live videos and was pretty impressed .
1451946213 it's how long she was in a coma i think
1451946215 yeah this is part 1 of that song
1451946223 summiz , over 200 but ive been spamming high maps and dying to bosses frankerz im lvl 88 or some shit

1451946250 destiny.gg - tool - wings for marie , part 1
1451946253 saynsh , no im not at all , but you bring no argument for me to either refute or agree with , this is the 3rd song ive ever heard from tool , so far i can say this is generic shit that anyone can do
1451946254 tool is a performance not just music u have to see them live kreygasm

1451946301 me > 8 =do: < ur mum
1451946301 tools guitar ability sounds like a 4 year old trying to learn how to play the guitar .
1451946309 the weight of love album blew me the fuck away .
1451946312 all these edgy rock listeners lul
1451946314 black keys have some weird songs though
1451946318 i can't listen to that shit d:
1451946319 ' objectively think ' is kind of oxymoronic

1451946377 i tought he over reacted with thos spine crawlers but nope apparently
1451946379 i guess it makes sense but that's not something you see every day
1451946382 is this what a crazy all-in
1451946395 the lone muta defense
1451946400 lol the offensive sporecrawler
1451946403 @gaiahero , altered state is fantastic album
1451946411 this off 2-base ?
1451946424 spore rush all in alrighty then
1451946427 the problem is , can destiny ever counterattack ?
1451946428 lings are soo fyking pööwefyll
1451946430 @destiny i would watch the crappiest games if the music was listenable . peace nigaa .
1451946444 this game is over
1451946454 is he lost bois ?
1451946458 the chat seems to have better taste in music than destiny kappa
1451946459 i'm pretty sure spend banes wreck destinys defense ...
1451946463 saynsh , well , im not knocking your taste and if you like it , more power to you , enjoy your music mate , but if we are going to have an objective discussion on music ( if you want ) than i would have to disagree with you because nothing i have heard from tool so far , is in any way intricate or unique
1451946464 ggwp ^ _ ^
1451946466 no , haven't lost we got a lurker
1451946473 arabian_night well now he's got lurkers
1451946477 @dcmccoy too long , did not read elegiggle
1451946480 beethoven sucks aswell . actually mozart sucks dick . all music is meh . everything sucks beethoven sucks aswell . actually mozart sucks dick . all music is meh . everything sucks
1451946480 tfw u voted yes on a strawpoll and now have to listen to this feelsbadman
1451946493 this is true turtle stephano style @airen13
1451946494 yeah , with the other guy having an extra base , i feel like it's going to be near impossible for him to come back at this point
1451946500 mfwhuehuehue , nice memez 5/7 m8 gr8 b8 would rate 8/8 kappa
1451946508 destiny tricked you all into this album by calling it 10 , 00000 gays lul kappa failfish
1451946509 peter_shaw if you say you hate all music , it's probably because you enjoy the silence of your mother's basement
1451946526 weow u got me there m8
1451946528 arabian_night yup , but only better because lurkers are better than swarmhosts
1451946529 i love this part ( the song )
1451946538 peter shaw is dead
1451946541 @airen13 , i bow to you sir
1451946543 ders . link/m8hah lol

1451946550 wow guys .. pacjax left us
1451946553 i see him on destinygg chat
1451946553 dcmccoy , im not talking about objectivity in music
1451946555 gay jokes are so 2010 kappa
1451946559 this moody part is amazing with the heavy lurker journey though
1451946561 totally rekted me xd weow i am destroyeriniod
1451946561 well if the opponent would have buily a single overseer lo9l
1451946563 destiny.gg - tool - 10,000 days ( wings , part 2 )
1451946571 why doesnt destiny seem to get any older as time goes on
1451946573 hey guys its me 4head
1451946583 kdaddyfresh it's the keanu reeves gene pool
1451946590 wtf how the fuck did this zerg get so many mutas
1451946594 no gg = mad 4head
1451946594 dcmccoy , and i dont really feel the need to " defend " a band i like just because you think its generic
1451946604 kdaddyfresh , because you have no life and watch him every day so it only seems like he doesn't age
1451946608 i just wonder , why does he never gg ?
1451946612 here comes the bass drop !
1451946617 im gonna go take a shower and wash off this shitty music be back later fam
1451946618 lol what a bad loser
1451946618 what did he report him for ?
1451946622 what is leave league abuse ?
1451946623 what with the gay ass shit music ?
1451946626 " leave league abuse " 4head
1451946627 it's over bois . duston econ broke an lurker tech ineffective .
1451946629 faintlive because gg means good game , and that game wasn'ta good one
1451946632 usorude , he actualy glitched
1451946632 destiny should be a pro league player
1451946635 @destiny , can we please move on from the first song ? thanks :)
1451946641 rizcantonai he used that glitch that alot of people are using
1451946642 @destiny is the leave league bug even bannable ?
1451946642 what is leave league abuse ??
1451946642 getting very tired of this music now
1451946644 ye but i've never seen him gg
1451946645 saynsh , you dont need to , but if you want to talk objectively about rock music , i could at least tell you 10 bands who did stuff taht exactly sounded like that
1451946645 @rizcantonai he used the leave league bug
1451946648 he fucking rushed zerglings and suddenly he has fucking over 9000 mutas .. legit kappaross
1451946649 hey destiny , this music fucking blows
1451946649 @destiny can you change your tunes ? i want to stay but i cant allow myself !
1451946652 rizcantonai , used the leave league glitch
1451946654 -21 points >.> such shit
1451946654 reported . for playing horrible music
1451946658 how did he cheat ?
1451946658 most guys here complaining about the music probably listen to generic music . so yeah ..
1451946659 rizcantonai there is a bug in the ladder system where you can leave your league and apparently get placed higher . i'm not exactly sure how it worsk but people are apparently abusing the system
1451946660 leaving leave gives you grandmaster mmr , that means destiny loses 20points and that guy gives him 1 point if destiny wins
1451946664 this song is taking 10,000 days to fucking end lol
1451946666 um the glitch is blizz fault
1451946667 plz stop this song
1451946673 this is as generic as it gets
1451946673 reported for not letting me win kappa
1451946674 how is this music not tolerable like wtf lol
1451946684 maybe tool would have been better if the sound didn't rape my ears . i think the mix or something doesn't help either
1451946685 how the fuck isnt this already fixed ? roflrolf
1451946688 no play me some bangers or gtfo kappa
1451946690 i also listen to monstercat and this music playing sucks
1451946701 why did this band name itself after its fans ?
1451946707 this song is like being stuck in traffic
1451946708 this shit is so repetitive omfg if i hear another g minor guitar chord im going to suicide bomb a rock concert
1451946709 @fingermydingleberry , because the musical ability of these guitarist sound like a 4 year old just learning how to play . \\
1451946714 airen13 thanks you very much for your answern :)
1451946716 its the dissonance with the drums and the semi chill flat line guitar sounds . its awful
1451946718 it'sa fucking exposition in custom electric pedals . that's fucking it ...
1451946721 if u like tool u may like incubus
1451946725 look i can play one note !!!!!
1451946732 whats the news on destinys twitter ?
1451946735 i smell another " reported for making me lose " coming up
1451946736 if you like tool you may like gangrape
1451946736 usorude , how is it blizz fault if you abuse a bug in a way its obviously not an accident
1451946742 win against leave leaguer +1-5 points . lose against leave leaguer -21 points
1451946745 why is destiny being such a depressing shitter today ?
1451946752 exploiting is not blizz fault
1451946755 because if blizz hadn't supplied the bug , he couldn't have used it
1451946759 @rociererer isnt that every day ? kappa
1451946765 well memed sir elegiggle
1451946766 don't blame the user blame the dealer
1451946771 @cobothegreat does it benefit their mmr or simply just the point system
1451946771 unintentional use of game mechanics is exploiting
1451946774 dcmccoy , its literally impossible to discuss music objectively , short of saying things like " in this song they used x instrument " . when the discussion boils down to things that bands have done before other bands objectivity disappears because there is always a chance that theres some that will like the later bands take on it .
1451946777 rociererer when has he ever been positive or upbeat ...
1451946779 just put on overlord by lamb of god and get your face melted
1451946787 destiny.gg - tool - 10,000 days ( wings , part 2 )
1451946788 yeah music inst objective
1451946792 well , he sometimes has some fuckin energy
1451946792 @usorude , he doesnt have to use the exploit . deactivate yourself fag
1451946803 usorude , that is like blaming the one who invented the gun when some criminal makes a massacre are you fucking retarded ?
1451946810 @destiny i hope you recover soon dude , heard the bad news , all the best wishes , ur gonna fight through the chemo like a champ
1451946814 @nforcesc , thats not even hard ... lol that song is literally the chillest of the album .
1451946818 just an opinion don't hate
1451946818 gah , this dude doesnt ready chat or care . i'm out !
1451946826 dcmccoy , just because x band wasnt the first who did something like music y , doesnt mean that people wont like them
1451946837 legendaryca , but the riffs in the second part are themost gg
1451946848 he has aids of the vag
1451946849 pretty sure no one died tonight lol , but if you want to compare to that fine
1451946850 if you want a better version of tool listen to porcupine tree
1451946859 tool does get old after like , two songs :p
1451946859 @littlelite , kinda hard when your playing shit
1451946863 why do people like tool
1451946870 dcmccoy , if thats your whole argument then you just come off as a stereotypical elitist hipster
1451946872 porcupine tree has very similar songs aswell
1451946885 lol , music may be subjective , but musical performance does have objective criteria . there are objectively bad and objectively good musicians out there .
1451946885 because they have simple minds , @sosoomad they are easy to please ;\\
1451946886 they worship tool because theyve never heard real music
1451946889 these songs blend together more than nickleback
1451946889 sosoomad , tool are like anal fisting . love it or hate it kind of thing
1451946889 beethoven sucks aswell . actually mozart sucks dick . all music is meh . everything sucks beethoven sucks aswell . actually mozart sucks dick . all music is meh . everything sucks
1451946889 at least porcupine tree is good though
1451946893 usorude its not about the situation but the way of arguing
1451946900 guys . gg chat is bullying me :(
1451946902 toastmaster7727 , whats real music to you
1451946906 saynsh , it actually is much easier than you make it out to be , its not about bands who take inspiration from a certain style , look at how many people covered the ultimate " generic rock " invented by bon jovi , there is so much good songs , but complete disregarding the option to objectively judge art like music , is simply wrong , thats why we have academia on those fields , there is objective comparisons to be made
1451946909 what is the leave league exploit ??
1451946917 burself_in_5 well then stop being such an autistic fuck ...
1451946917 4head if i wanted to hear a joke i'd ask for your one rep maxes 4head
1451946918 then stop being a fucking retard
1451946919 @burself_in_5 , lol get rekt fag kappa

1451947133 dcmccoy , to me , objectivity will always take backseat , i just listen to music i like , wether its opeth or fall out boy . i guess what i'm trying to say is i'm able to enjoy " generic " trash if it speaks to be . i imagine its different for intellectuals , but i am a mere mortal after all .
1451947133 bucketfacez at gm , a win gives you a couple points , a loss loses you 20ish . so you can drop ranks very fast with losses :(
1451947134 dream : race is black i think ..
1451947141 @airen13 you are right its better to use 14-18 years old children to fight for you
1451947151 does he realize he isnt listening to " good " tool
1451947156 steben doesn't like tool :(
1451947164 thats a poor argument ...
1451947165 is he speaking english ?
1451947167 vaultboy usa has the best universities , best technology , best military , best athletes , and the biggest economy in the world . don't be jealous of the usa just because we pwn you . go donald trump go ! vaultboy
1451947169 1m realdeal888 : 96% = past text
1451947172 hard to like tool much after you've listened to the best work of dream theater and pain of salvation , among others from other genre
1451947177 this guy picked the worst albim
1451947177 saynsh for music to even make it your ears , it has to be objectively evaluated , lol .
1451947182 shut up you fucking ***
1451947182 the band he's listening to or ?
1451947184 i have never heard anyone say tool is similar every says they sounds random asfuck ...
1451947185 everything is the same . everything is meh . everything is boring . meh . kill me . meh . boring
1451947186 why can't people just like songs ? i love this song but i think tool is okay all around
1451947187 nforcesc , yeah i agree
1451947187 its not boring to 15 year olds tho
1451947188 does @destiny just reponse to @peter_shaw ?
1451947188 well maynard hates tool in that sense
1451947189 nforcesc , comparing dream theater to tool failfish
1451947191 elegiggle everyone is triggered rn
1451947192 rap rock metal band with a dj . woot bro
1451947194 imho its the best tool album and moreover its one of the best albums ever made
1451947201 whiteguycash , i dont even know what that means
1451947202 linkin park is better obv
1451947205 i didn't know about tool before this album but i still love it .
1451947205 oh no he just shatered my world
1451947209 you can like songs without liking artists
1451947209 this music is kinda lame sounding tbh fam :/
1451947210 i like tool , but i agree their stuff mostly sounds the same . i can only listen to it here and there .
1451947211 tools live performances over there years are second to none
1451947211 hotquacamole , not comparing them . it's just a lot more variety and different melodies/ structres
1451947211 oh look another zvz , what a surprise 4head
1451947213 put some real musik like skrillex mau5 kappa
1451947213 every band has a distinct formula and style every single band does
1451947222 is he that mean about radiohead as well ?
1451947222 the last 30mins of music pretty much put me to sleep
1451947230 @peter_shaw please listen to him
1451947232 make a post on r/music so u can realise why you are wrong kappa
1451947234 genre is just a type of classification
1451947235 nine inch nails is better
1451947236 3 hatch before pool in zvz = rip

1451947300 usa invented the internet , created sc2 , and twitchtv is american . you are using the internet ( invented in the usa ) , watching sc2 ( created in the usa ) , and using twitchtv ( an american company ) . gg . usa > eu
1451947301 @destiny the beatles are a bad band because they played the wrong genre of music they should have played gangster rap
1451947301 learning to live <3

1451947341 what is it mean tool ?
1451947351 this is why i love im so much all song ar completely different and different genres
1451947351 realdeal888 , and anyone who invented those things isnt actual american ...
1451947353 @peter_shaw is a tool
1451947354 no its not tool
1451947356 destiny.gg - linkin park - in the end
1451947356 what is it mean ?
1451947357 the fact that you talk about music like this just makes you seem like an asshole lol
1451947360 the music software is foobar2000
1451947362 while you're tooling your tool
1451947365 airen13 talking about enemy zerg mind
1451947366 saynsh , you are right , art is more subjective than objective , not saying these songs are awful trash so if you enjoy that , go ahead , i know i enjoy some generic shit aswell . also i am not an " intellectual " . i'm merely pointing out that this music is in no way bringing much value , nor unique factors to the rock genre , tool is an alright band , i could listen to that occasionally , but objectively , they pale in comparison to truly great bands
1451947367 saynsh shit music doesn't get published by a label , big or small . it may be subjectively bad once it comes off the recording studio , but that's due to the personal preference you are talking about . objectively : the lyrics , instrumentation , mix , effects , mastering have all been made objectively good based on objective standards within respective fields .
1451947374 this is the worst argument ive ever heard failfish
1451947377 lol linkin park minglee
1451947380 linkin park now that is a good band
1451947380 craaaaaawling iiiiiin my craaaawl
1451947380 kreygasm oh the throwback
1451947384 destiny , i guess you need to get high on a fat joint to like tool i guess
1451947386 just listen to steely dan
1451947393 hybrid theory and meteora were good though
1451947395 keep rollin rollin rollin
1451947396 dualcore , they are all american
1451947400 how much fuckin music does he have
1451947402 why not compare other maynard bands ?
1451947405 destiny just did 8th notes and the bassline was 4th notes ....
1451947405 whiteguycash , not true at all
1451947406 did i just see kayne west ....
1451947413 it doesn't even matter dude , its their style
1451947414 did he just say " authentic jazz " ? rofl wat
1451947416 destiny has to be trolling failfish
1451947417 lmao ... stream the game destiny .. critiquing music is not your forte
1451947426 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5
1451947429 i only listen to conuterfeit jazz
1451947439 how about , it's okay to like a song without loving a band .......
1451947441 i have a crazy idea
1451947451 geddy lee though kreygasm
1451947452 i cant even hear the bass on that
1451947459 tool is progressive metal
1451947466 prog metal most probably
1451947471 its some progressive stuff
1451947476 they got some good shit
1451947476 tool is psychedelic prog rock
1451947487 please .... no music ... just games
1451947492 genres alternative metal art rock progressive metal progressive rock
1451947493 so prog metal bands can't have " a sound " ?
1451947502 destiny you are arguing subjectivity like its objectivity
1451947504 pure sc2 to our veins
1451947507 love this song kreygasm
1451947510 actually if you stfu i'll take more music instead lol
1451947513 thought on toe ?
1451947514 steream992 , mute it or fuck off breh
1451947531 saynsh , he is actually doing an objective assesment right now
1451947533 this is lame . i'm going to do heroine
1451947534 stream922 is only here to stalk me minglee
1451947537 tool = genres alternative metal art rock progressive metal progressive rock
1451947538 " in my opinion , i guess "

1451947540 1m gaiahero : 96% = past text
1451947545 isnt tool " prog metal " ?
1451947552 if only destiny conducted arguments everytime this way instead of telling people to go kill themselves kappa
1451947554 no , post metal is not screamo
1451947559 dcmccoy , no , not at all
1451947562 destiny , try dead soul tribe instead
1451947562 who cares about genres
1451947565 what is metal ?
1451947566 genres people come up with failfish
1451947566 @scrilla211 talk to my german body guard @peter_shaw
1451947567 i think there is alot of variety in tools music
1451947568 so why aren't they allowed that ? because of what their supposed genre should be ? sounds like your defending them really
1451947569 idk .. but i do know tool is one of the 194 classifications of metal 4head
1451947576 just off to bed now ... can you keep talking for another 5 mins been having difficulty sleeping
1451947583 dcmccoy , he's arguing things from his tastes point of view
1451947585 progressive electronic death garage door metal
1451947588 saynsh , he is , he is talking about buildups , diversity
1451947589 opeth has 30 thousand bass flows
1451947603 @destiny what's you think about infected mushroom ?
1451947604 opeth is so good though kreygasm
1451947605 saynsh stop typing , you don't know what you are talking about . you are like a young earth creationist trying to talk about evolutionary biology . everybody in the room except you knows you don't know what you are talking about .
1451947607 ratm is good as fuck play them
1451947611 @destiny play dream theatre ecstarcy of gold
1451947611 its just me or the only guy the really understand twitch is morrow ?
1451947611 saynsh , thats not true at all , destiny is a music major , he is not going into subjective material
1451947616 tool has a dirtier vibe than most even though it's not heavy
1451947621 paint here we go boys
1451947623 ms paint time boys pogchamp
1451947642 devin townsend is the empire state building :]
1451947645 haha thanks ms paint
1451947649 that empire state building , wonder why it still stands
1451947650 destiny , you know how comparing music works lol
1451947653 jesus christ , the pseudointellectualism in this chat
1451947653 tool makes good music , doesn't really matter if it's repetitive . maynard went more progressive in puscifer . he didn't do much experimentation in tool he instead did it all in puscifer
1451947656 you know jaya the cat ?
1451947656 devin townsend is beyond measurement kappaross
1451947660 opeth and tool are both considered progressive metal , not exactly the same though
1451947665 what are we seeing this ?
1451947666 cheesy acoustic guitar harmonies = not formulaic . datsheffy
1451947668 tool = rebecca black heyguys
1451947668 where is sc2 gone ?
1451947673 kkona someone say corn ? kkona
1451947675 @destiny what's you think about infected mushroom ?
1451947681 naw , corn and opec is different as fuck
1451947682 @destiny , you like devin townsend at all ?
1451947682 archive - my nigga
1451947682 can we just keep listening to tool feelsbadman
1451947683 this stream is about sc2 ?
1451947684 destiny , gojira maybe , apc , puscifer
1451947691 compare tool to 2pac kappa
1451947693 stream922 can you kill yourself ? holy fuck we get it
1451947697 @destiny what about kyuss
1451947705 snuwerd , nice meme
1451947709 the bottom of his face moves a lot horizontally when he speaks
1451947710 tools drummer is fuckin insane
1451947710 stream922 , gtfo damn
1451947712 destiny let's listen to some opeth then :d
1451947714 i see we have a primus fan :d
1451947716 listenin to their music on albums doesnt do them justice
1451947717 @totalolivier no i cant you mom need me to stay a live and give her hope
1451947719 kyus = stoner rock
1451947721 been conceeeiving you for too longgg
1451947721 @destiny what's about infected mushroom ?
1451947722 listen to jaya the cat !!!
1451947723 i saw them live and it was intense
1451947724 even a perfect circle sounds really similar to tool
1451947725 riverside got some good songs , but they are also repetitive as fuck
1451947727 @destiny progressive rock/metal is a very loose genre and tool is definitely progressive in some areas but not others
1451947729 @destiny , puscifer is where maynard started to change the sound up a lot tool was a pretty basic sound because it worked for them
1451947730 so lets forget about the white boys and slap on some 50 cent
1451947734 system of a down : same genre , much more versatile
1451947735 @sirampr ok sir yes sir
1451947738 i don't think you'll see this message , but man listen to haken , in the genre their the best and most enjoyable by far
1451947739 tool reminds me of bruno mars
1451947741 so because you feel like they arent allowed to mix chill and repetition with other stuff you think you are saying they're objectively bad ?
1451947743 mastodon ? we power rangers now ? kappa
1451947744 you need to listen to their new stuff lmao
1451947745 why is he rank 56 ? o.o wasnt he like 30 something ?
1451947750 soad sounds like shit live tho imo
1451947751 baitoet , lol what , soad is like the kiddiest of anything
1451947751 that album came out in year 1
1451947754 animals as leaders pls minglee
1451947758 mastodon has one good album though
1451947759 whiteguycash , you literally said that only objectively good music can be published
1451947761 @stream922 destiny is mostly known for his character and personality so that you complain about him talking freely in his own stream will never change anything
1451947771 listen to jaya the cat !!!
1451947774 @ismaellamare , points are scarce mate

1451947871 implying kanye fans aren't the worst nathanruse
1451947872 puscifer is much better than tool in my opinion , i much prefer maynards newer stuff in puscifer
1451947874 usa has the best healthcare in the world . we have the most advanced medical technology , most advanced hospitals , and best doctors in the world .
1451947885 where do destiny fans rate ? nr 4 ? 4head

1451947899 radiohead - pyramid song . so good .

1451947983 yep , tool albums all have their feels , and some even could be bound together in 2 or 3 albums a pack and they sound extremely simmilar
1451947987 linkin park is pretty bad , its on the same level as nickelback
1451947989 tool albums are written to be taken as one continuous song that's why maynard won't put them on streaming services , at least that's what he said
1451947991 neutral milk hotel people are aids anghropomorphised
1451947993 yeah infected mushroom overrustle
1451947996 usa has best donald trump

1451949800 nazis just had more technology by that point

1451949848 ting ting ting ting
1451949851 @snowwywolf take your fucking copy pasta elsewhere you fuckin shitter
1451949854 @mangomosh are you retarded ? you didnt start even with a valid argument . your thesis of hitler being an ok guy is hilarious
1451949855 and today germany is the only nation helping the refugees compared to the us who doesnt give a shit
1451949861 yes but when you spend 200/200 on charge it can tend to fuck you on ur unit count
1451949862 whats more important btw , shields or armor upgrades ?
1451949868 " refugees " niceme . me
1451949871 @prokeyboard , one doesn't excuse the other , but atrocities committed within the past 100 or so years are a lot more palpable since chances are there's people who are still alive today who lived through that shit , and there are also photos of it
1451949874 traiborn < confirmed cuck fag :d
1451949876 @scylok you usally only make the atttack upgrade
1451949880 600_watt_microwave , 600_watt_microwave , 600_watt_microwave , 600_watt_microwave , 600_watt_microwave , 600_watt_microwave , 600_watt_microwave , 600_watt_microwave , kappa
1451949881 @traiborn on a scale from 1 to autistically furious , what are you right now ?
1451949886 @taijisc2 actually canada has brought in thousands of refugees .
1451949900 hitler killed jews guys , its not like he did anything wrong .
1451949901 since armor and shield can be made later as protoss should focus more on the attack imo @scylok
1451949913 @taijisc2 could never had been more wrong , sweden is bringing in the most refugees per cpa ....
1451949913 @scylok you should prob ask pacjax though since he knows better
1451949914 theres photos of the indians being hanged etc . @sa1tycoins
1451949916 he not only killed jews
1451949922 lol destiny's twitter account got suspended
1451949925 killing jews should actually be a legal past time , you should be able to go out and buy a jew hunting license
1451949929 only half of the people killed in camps were jews
1451949929 he killed gays too
1451949930 @bernstgunnar i thought that was norway kappa
1451949931 thousands of refugees is like nothing
1451949946 you are americans are overpowerdly stupod
1451949948 they gotta keep their oil money kappa
1451949950 america can't handle more refugees , they already have 10 million illegal mexicans not paying a single shred of taxes and leaching the economy and lowering wages to worry about , germany can keep all the muslims and get enriched alone notears germancucks
1451949965 haha i used to think jews were weird too . then i got with this jewish chick so now i like jews . they are just people like us
1451949966 i need a space heater .
1451949970 no western country should be obliged to accept refugees , it's not our problem
1451949976 why do people talk about refugees so much ? if you were in a war-torn area and in their position , you would hope and pray that someone would take you in .
1451949979 prokeyboard , jidf go away
1451949986 ur an complete idiot little
1451949987 don't be so certain of yourselves , hitler would've started gassing autists after he was done with the jews
1451949991 sa1tycoins we created the problem
1451949992 destiny.gg - lunatic soul - impression viii
1451949996 usa invented the internet , created all video games , and twitchtv is american . you are using the internet ( invented in the usa ) , watching games ( created in the usa ) , and using twitchtv ( an american company )
1451949998 if you bitch about refugees you have absolutely no sense of empathy
1451950001 " not our problem " wow , nice human kappa
1451950003 @ship_it_holla_ballas he did gas autists ...
1451950007 catsnthings , no , i would join the army and fight for my country or try to leave it with my wife , my children or mother
1451950016 ship_it_holla_ballas i'm autistic biblethump
1451950040 actually us was founded by europeans so the argument is idiotiv
1451950041 @mangomosh yes ... and ? leaving makes you a refugee
1451950043 hitler was already killing old and mentally disabled people
1451950045 canada has plans to bring in 25,000 refugees . for a population of 35 million thats a start
1451950053 eventually there needs to come a time when these refugees quit being refugees and start doing something to change whats going on in their homeland
1451950055 jidf what does that mean ?
1451950059 > caring more about refugees than the millions of your native country men and women that will live worse because of them , getting raped killed mugged , forced to change the way they live to please allah > literally fucking cuckholds in this chat > not killing themselves
1451950061 i guess the us fucked the middle east pretty badly , they should fix it then
1451950069 @dangur lol , you think people aren't working tirelessly to do that ?
1451950070 people bitching about refugees are dumb trash
1451950073 jeah nobody says something about canada they are lovely people
1451950082 lol , the us govt doesn't care about the us
1451950083 pretty sure the middle east was fucked to begin with
1451950087 and you're a fucking cuckold @zerevorr deactivate yourself

1451950167 people talking shit about refugees don't understand the privilege of being born into a free country .
1451950175 ur an pegida guy or something
1451950176 " germany will profit from a million uneducated farmers who can't speak the language and are from a backwards country where women are treated like dogs , and men can rape women freely and the women gets killed if she protests > german cucks actually believe this > mfw duckerz
1451950186 you are a retard ... thats all
1451950196 littlefaces ... seek help
1451950204 no you have no sense of economical basics child
1451950204 only the most deluded retards would ever argue that taking in refugees is profitable , to our politicians it'sa matter of cucking purposely cucking oneself
1451950208 hitler was in the right elegiggle
1451950213 the people who makes it the western countries are not refugees . migrants .
1451950221 no one says refugees are bad people , the problem is the costs of taking them in catsnthings
1451950228 omg nazi kaiser confirmed

1451950283 the us government does what the 1% wants it to do . not enough people understand this . or that most politicians are just dbag lawyers that vote themselves raises everywhere . for those reasons i wouldn't mind seeing bernie . at least he would try to stop the greed
1451950284 my phd thesis is going to be the flow and pattern of conversations in twitch chat feelsgoodman conversation about topic a - b - ... to z
1451950286 truth : taking in refugees in the short tirm is costly ? yes ! but in the long run they make up for it economicly speaking
1451950288 kaiser = midern neonazi go to hell ill hope u get arrested soon
1451950294 if you want to fuck my 21 year old girlfriend , drop me a message :) - uk only .

1451950305 url the reason why all our elections are bought , doesn't matter who you vote for elegiggle
1451950312 they took our jobs
1451950318 taijisc2 : blind liberal piece of shit ... i hope you get stabbed by fucking arabs
1451950319 tumblr is for bdsm porn
1451950323 so your saying all dem mexicans we took in built stuff and worked real hard at low wages ? i don't get it
1451950325 and they create jobs
1451950329 in sweden , after 8 years roughly 50% of all refugees have jobs . how much welfare money have they absorbed at that point you think ?
1451950330 short term matters a ton , especially in the eu
1451950337 how can they create job
1451950338 where is pacjax feelsbadman
1451950338 cant .... watch ... the ... cox
1451950339 bernstgunnar how will taking a million+ people with 0 education , who can't speak your language , from a completely different culture , who won't assimilate help the economy duckerz are you seriously this retarded
1451950342 term limits would fix everything

1451950347 kaiser is personally threatening me like all nazi dumbasses do
1451950352 look at pacjax talking in all caps on gg chat
1451950354 german police hunt for a massive gang of up to 1,000 men ' of arab and north african origin ' who sexually assaulted numerous women and threw fireworks into crowds at cologne train station on new year's eve . go fuck yourselves liberals more to come
1451950355 the main problem with refugees is europe not working together , and thats because of shitty nationalist countries .
1451950357 @petitdalf by taking it from the native citizens kappa
1451950359 im not threatening you
1451950362 yes , let them all die because human life is too costly
1451950364 get arrested criminal nazi
1451950365 i only hope u get stabbed by arabs
1451950367 anyone that says ' refugees cost the economy ' don't realise that a ) they eventually contribute , in great ways to the place they're emigrating to , and b ) most people born in the country are massive sponges , so really it's not about ' costing the economy ' it's about ' don't take what's mine ' .
1451950370 pacjax is on a top secret mission
1451950372 who says they are not educated ?
1451950376 borders are a bourgeoisie invention , i dont believe the concept of ' refugees ' is legitimate
1451950377 not many pro streamers on twitch for sc2 disappointig
1451950380 well swedish polititians have fucked us so bad . we are the next greece .
1451950381 europe is a big country and should take more refugees
1451950383 do you know the plight of the refugee
1451950388 germany is the usa of europe
1451950391 people with ur attitude should be deported instead of refugees
1451950395 destiny.gg - lunatic soul - gravestone hill ( remix )

1451950519 i wonder when usa is gonna invade germany cause it is a muslim country now
1451950523 @littlefaces the irony of your repetitive use of the word ' retarded ' is lost on you ... why is that ? elegiggle
1451950532 quite dank dicedlemming nathandank
1451950534 saying that every refugee is a rappist who will rape everyone is just so ignorant

1451950550 no need . germany is full of us army bases
1451950555 it's always surprising to see how bio terrans produce more units than they lose
1451950558 its the only country with human standards so get lost
1451950560 you see pictures of refugees who owns iphones and expensive clothes its not because they steal that shit they bought it .
1451950562 @littlefaces there it is again :)
1451950566 yeah a lot of rappists like snoop dogg arent so bad
1451950569 you are right ... they already invaded in the late 40s
1451950570 dark templars accepted the protoss from aiur as refugees didnt they ? :)
1451950574 what most people from north america fail to realize is that europe is in no way a unity in the same way that the united states are . pretty much every country in europe speaks a different language , and far from every country in europe is part of the european union . and the european union is not one nation like the united states are . it's more like an economic alliance between countries that has a few shared laws that members of the union can freely choose to opt out of .
1451950581 life isnt a video game gawntlet you manchild
1451950584 wow twitch-chat you guys are catching up with the toxic-meme-ness that is destiny.gg chat ... keep it up young ones

1451950622 @gawntlet the templars drained a lot of resource to create the golden armada and
1451950624 of course barely literate box-cutter armed failed-their-airline-license bombers overtook miliatary trained combat pilots to target the trade centers and pentagon , in the air for over 40 minutes , without even a tickle from a fighter jet ... oh and they hit the pentagon right in the budget office where rumsfeld was being investigated for 2.3 trillion dollars that went missing from dod budget
1451950632 snowwywolf , how much is that in metric
1451950633 well 8 ichnes is more than average
1451950634 dahktor you can say baited but truth is that most americans actually don't understand it , so chances are i educated someone with that copypaste
1451950640 i just don't understand the hate for people who don't live in your country and need help , like holy shit , how heartless and completely selfish can you be ?

1451951432 @gawntlet he may be . but so many lawyers are just complete dbags once they get out . also you probably come from a rich family if ur bro is going to law school
1451951435 winter looks like a high school ?
1451951441 that's pretty far out there
1451951442 winter view bots too btw
1451951445 he's the viewbot guy right ?
1451951445 destiny.gg - tsutchie - adapt myself
1451951445 people who get baited on the essey troll just pretend to get baited to bait other people
1451951448 he looks like a buiding ?
1451951453 zerg looks like parasites brokeback brokeback brokeback
1451951458 your mom sucks winter's cock
1451951471 actually winter looks like that kid in high school that gets picked on a lot that you kind of feel sorry for
1451951476 hashbeansc2 , well good for her i was hoping she would revitalize her sex life after dad died

1451951511 winter is a good guy mrdestructoid
1451951512 i would like to send the swat team over to destiny's house who knows the address ? omgscoots
1451951516 winter actually has an ego based on his ' efame '
1451951517 i got the memes in me going baaack to back
1451951521 basically nathan will look like winter in 3 years .
1451951524 imagine winter in the real world
1451951528 this chat increases my iq
1451951529 will you plebes just stfu about winter
1451951532 k1ash3r , you are an inspiration . you are not afraid to be flamboyant and admit that you live an alternative lifestyle . i think you are one of the best inbred autists on twitch and you are a great role model . i know some people probably don't understand , but i do .
1451951532 my memes meme themselves
1451951533 @hashbeansc2 , no idea , but i know i envy no man who has to pay for it
1451951538 how much he would get picked on
1451951550 @hashbeansc2 ya if winter even does have a real girlfriend she is obviously a loser if she puts up with him . or she likes money
1451951553 winter's actually a ' celebrity ' that's how fucked up this new media is
1451951560 winter wouldnt get picked on because he's worth more than any of you .
1451951561 you don't require talent to get fame these days
1451951565 yeah that's my point
1451951573 winter pay for pussy ? rofl winter gets more pussy than rifkin , he doesnt have to pay for pussy you retards
1451951580 before you had actual people with talent make it in entertainment
1451951586 now you have people like winter and youtube stars lol
1451951592 rifkin wishes he can get zombie grubs pussy elegiggle
1451951597 does slayers boxer still play starcraft ?
1451951602 @hashbeansc2 , you really think his girl isn't there for the easy money ? lmao
1451951608 @hashbeansc2 go troll elsewhere , everyone knows winter is a homo who rides dick when he isnt on ladder
1451951608 haha rifkin get pussy ? you are retarded . guy is a virgin
1451951609 @ship_it_holla_ballas he did in the blizcon show
1451951609 winter is the only foreigner who can take games off koreans and anyone who disagrees needs to check their fucking privilege
1451951615 mar45690 , how recent is that ?
1451951622 @ship_it_holla_ballas two month ago
1451951627 where he did a show match
1451951627 zombie grub probably lets rifkin blow her every night they go to sleep in their streamer house
1451951632 you savage ass mofo
1451951632 can we get kyle and catz in a call for old time's sake ?

1451951653 destiny , cool jacket m8 deilluminati
1451951653 shit , he's ddosing someone
1451951654 lol i figured i was too obvious when i said rifkin gets pussy .. obvious troll is obvious
1451951659 @ship_it_holla_ballas i think during blizcon so 3 or a week before lotv release
1451951660 i would fuck the shit out of zombiegrub
1451951664 mar45690 , thanks i found it
1451951674 man destiny sounds like he needs a nap
1451951676 woodenbeem it essentially makes it so if destiny wins he only gets like 2 points but if he loses he loses 25 points
1451951677 zombie grub doesnt like penis i'm sure
1451951680 i might do zombiegrub . not sure , haven't decided yet
1451951680 she loves the vagina
1451951682 destiny.gg - tsutchie - adapt myself
1451951686 what's up destiny mind explaining why you 72h ip banned me for no reason pepe also play poker you cuck
1451951690 winter gets to relevancy by viewbotting , then convinces basically everyone that he viewbots by being blatant enough then gets almost banned for it because it is proven , then nothing happens and winter keeps getting 2k+ viewers and still viewbots and still no one gives a fuck , and hes returned to being featured on front page and tl.net . nice datsheffy
1451951693 no , that's scarlett
1451951711 zombie thinks she's too good for rifkin . but that nagging itch is the only thing bad on btv
1451951717 hey destiny i hope you're reading this elegiggle
1451951717 zombiegrub is a little awkward , probably a virgin . would love to get that tight , untouched pussy
1451951719 you should die in a fire
1451951723 if you call scarlett a he on /r/starcraft you get permbanned
